marathon life sciences (marathon ls) is a team of manufacturer-trained service engineers who 
utilize 85+ years of maintenance, repairs, and calibration of laboratory equipment experience.  
our main goal is long-term equipment efficiency.  we also stock laboratory consumables, which 
offers a stable supply chain and allows us to deliver an unparalleled experience for clients. 
our team relies on thorough communication and clearly set expectations to deliver exemplary 
customer service. we understand that delays resulting from sourcing difficulties can have large 
impacts on productivity, especially when it comes to the students or employees relying on 
necessary laboratory supplies. we want to ensure that you lose as little time as possible to 
maintain efficiency. 
laboratory supplies 
marathon ls’ lab supplies line includes dishes, flasks, strainers and 
filtration products, tubes, plates and reservoirs, pipets and pipette 
tips, and pcr strips and tubes. we frequently update the products 
we offer and are committed to improvement by customer-driven 
feedback.  if you need a laboratory product we do not currently 
provide, our customer service experts will help you find what you 
are looking for. 
because we produce our own branded products, we have 
extensive knowledge regarding lab supplies and can provide 
high quality materials without the need for a middleman.  all 
products we offer, we have immediate access to. this results in 
speedier delivery times to get clients the supplies they need.  
we understand that efficiency and quality are both equally 
important for success, and the ability to source in-demand, 
sometimes hard to obtain products sets us apart. 
as a smaller company, marathon ls is more in control of the supplies we provide our 
customers. we have a strong focus on customer service, quick response times, and you’ll be 
working with the same dedicated team of individuals every time.  we’ve also begun the process 
to providing laboratory supplies that are solely manufactured in the united states.

capabilities statement 
redc invents and manufactures clean energy technologies that help 
solve some of the world’s most pressing issues today. our technologies 
serve the needs of those in developed and developing nations. we tackle 
difficult problems, such as; climate change, malnutrition, food security, 
irrigation, rural electrification and clean water. 
naics codes: 22111, 335220, subsector 335 
 
redc’s hydrokinetic prime mover: converts the hydrokinetic energy from flowing water into mechanical energy with 
little to if any impact on the environment. the mechanical energy is used to pump water uphill for energy storage and irrigation. 
water current is deflected by the fender into buckets and away from the returning collapsed buckets. the buckets pull a chain 
around sprockets, which turn a set of gears and a shaft. the shaft is connected to a centrifugal pump for uphill water pumping.  
rural communities that are located close to flowing rivers and mountains now have the ability to create reliable, carbon-free energy 
24 hours a day with our hydrokinetic pumped energy storage system. dams become more efficient by recouping waste energy for 
reuse. small-scale farmers in developing nations now have the ability to irrigate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
redc’s solar food preservation facility: (sfpf) preserves nutritious foods long-term for small-scale farmers in 
developing nations without needing access to electricity. the sfpf comes equipped with a walk-in cooler for short-term storage of 
nutritious foods. the glass jar canning room helps farmers create new products for their businesses. the preserved, fresh food 
provides community members with low-cost, nutritious food year round. pregnant and nursing mothers can now provide their 
children with the proper micronutrients a growing body requires. "

we disagree.

use, is the very foundation of how we look at ourselves and 
each other. how we interact with each other, how we engage 
with one another. it only makes sense to use this common 
necessity in life to innovate new ways of doing business with 
each other but also, use the very product that defines our 
individuality, as a springboard to engage with one another. 
 
if we can â€œengageâ€ with one another, we can â€œunderstandâ€ 
each other. if we can understand each other, we can make our 
country better. allow us to show you how we can make our 
country better through engagement and innovative services

rpm, and torque as a regular motor.  
 
about us:

our vision is to revolutionize the field of 
electrical engineering by using our patented 
technology to provide efficiency, cost 
savings, and increased capabilities to our 
customers as well as increased options for 
the nationâ€™s electric grid. we are a service 
disabled veteran owned business.  
what we do 
our patented technology is the industry 
leader in electric motor energy savings. at 
condor, we take a customerâ€™s existing motor

dear ms forus:
congratulations! your firm has been certified as a participant in the u.s. small
business administration's (sba) 8(a) business development program. your nine
(9) year program term begins on the date of this letter.
during participation in the 8(a) business development program, you will receive
business development assistance from an assigned business development
specialist in the richmond district office, 400 north 8th street, suite 1150,
richmond, va 23240. the phone number is (804) 771- 2400. we are sending a
copy of this certification letter to the sba richmond district office. that office will
contact you to schedule an orientation session. this could take up to 4-6 weeks.
in the meantime, there are steps you should take to start your participation in the
program.
next steps
• read and sign participation agreement: sba requires the 8(a) participant’s
president or chief executive officer sign a participation agreement showing he
or she understands the conditions of 8(a) bd program participation. please find
the agreement attached to the approval email associated with this letter. please
read the agreement carefully, sign and date it, and make a copy. return one
copy to the sba richmond district office at the address shown in the second
paragraph above. the second copy is for your records.
• develop your business plan: we encourage you to start developing your
business plan. current 8(a) bd program regulations require a firm, once certified,
to promptly submit a business plan which must be approved by the sba before
the firm is eligible to receive 8(a) benefits; including 8(a) contracts. once
approved, the business plan will be reviewed annually and may be modified as
needed. we offer an optional format for business plans. to consider the optional
8(a) business plan form 1010c, please go to: https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/
files/sba%201010c.pdf.
• develop your strategy for winning contracts in year 1: though your firm’s
approved north american industry classification system (naics) code is
561621, your firm may be awarded contracts under other naics codes, as long
as your firm is qualified to perform the required service or task. in this regard,
please note that contracts awarded under 8(a) business development program
authority generally result from the self-marketing efforts of participating firms.
you must build relationships with potential federal customers, pursue federal
prime contractors for subcontracts, and aggressively pursue prime contract
opportunities to grow your business. successful 8(a) firms regularly respond to
competitive small business contracting opportunities posted on www.fbo.gov.
establish a goal and vision for winning at least two (2) competitive contracts
during your first year.
• utilize resources: there are valuable free resources available to you right
now that offer expertise in all areas of business operation including reviewing
your business plan and strategy. two resources that you can utilize today are:
o sba resource partners: i encourage you to locate your nearest resource
partner, please go to: https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance. this link will
provide access to upcoming small business events and the webpage for your
district sba office, also.
o 7(j) management and technical assistance: while your firm’s acceptance into
the 8(a) business development program is not a guarantee for contracts, the
sba will make every effort to assist you in implementing your business plan and
strategy. your success in the program is dependent upon the extent to which you
take advantage of sba’s efforts to support you. one of the agency’s major tools
for your success is the 7(j) management and technical assistance services
program. for more information, click on the following link: https://www.sba.gov/
about-sba/sba-initiatives/7j-management-and-technical-assistance-services-

i am excited about your future, and i welcome you as an 8(a) business
development program participant. wishing you much success!

dear steven forus:
congratulations! . . . welcome to the hubzone program!
i am pleased to advise you that effective this date, diverse solutions group inc. has been approved for certification as a ""qualified hubzone small business concern (sbc)"".
the firm is now eligible for hubzone opportunities and will be included on the list of qualified hubzone small business concerns found at
http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/search/dsp_searchhubzone.cfm. this certification will remain in effect unless sba later determines that the firm does not meet the eligibility
requirements of the program or the firm submits a voluntary decertification form. the information below sets forth facts concerning the company's continued eligibility and its
responsibilities. 
the firm's responsibilities as a hubzone certified concern
as a hubzone certified concern, the program benefits the firm may receive come with important responsibilities, including:
keeping the firm's system for award management (sam) and dynamic small business search (dsbs) records up-to-date. to apply for hubzone program
certification, the firm had to be registered in sam and dsbs. for the firm to receive benefits from the hubzone program (i.e., to be identified by contracting officers as
eligible to receive hubzone contracts and to be paid under any such contracts), these records must remain up-to-date. you must validate the firm's information at
least annually or your sam registration will become inactive. if you need assistance in updating the firm's sam or dsbs information, please go to the sam help desk
at https://fsd.gov/fsd-gov/home.do.
informing the hubzone program of any material changes to the concern. if there are material changes to the concern that may affect its continued eligibility, you
must notify the hubzone program by sending an e-mail to hzmcn@sba.gov. material changes include a change in name, size, ownership, business structure, or
principal office location, in addition to falling below the 35% employee hubzone residency requirement when the firm is not performing on a hubzone contract.
failure to notify the hubzone program of material changes may result in decertification from the program. if at any time the concern no longer qualifies for the
hubzone program, the individual authorized to represent the firm can complete the ""voluntary decertification agreement"" available at
http://www.sba.gov/content/maintaining-hubzone-certification.
note: the hubzone program sends notices regarding program examinations, proposed decertifications, and re-certifications to the firm's physical and email
addresses of record. if the firm fails to respond to these notices because the firm relocated without updating its sam and dsbs profiles and informing the hubzone
program, sba will propose the firm for decertification and may subsequently decertify it from the program. therefore, it is critical that you check your email's spam
folder to make sure that you are receiving emails from sba, notify us of any change in the physical address and keep the firm's sam and dsbs profiles current.
remaining in compliance at all times and staying updated on program changes. it is the firm's responsibility to continually ensure that it meets the requirements
of the program. this includes, for example, continuously meeting the 35% hubzone residency requirement. the firm can make good faith efforts to ""attempt to
maintain"" (see definition at 13 c.f.r. § 126.103) having 35% of its employees reside in a hubzone during the performance of a hubzone contract it received (as a
prime, not as a subcontractor). but, the business must meet this residency requirement anytime it submits an offer on and receives a new hubzone contract. this also
includes complying with contract performance requirements in connection with any hubzone contracts awarded to the firm as a qualified hubzone sbc (e.g., the
subcontracting limitations requirements set forth in 13 c.f.r. § 126.700, and/or the non-manufacturer rule set forth in 13 c.f.r. § 126.601(e)).
periodically visiting our website (http://www.sba.gov/hubzone) to keep up-to-date with the program requirements and geographical designations. check
sba's hubzone mapping pages to determine whether changes in hubzone area designations impact or will impact the firm's eligibility at
http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-maps. while there, sign up to receive hubzone news updates via email; and when you need help, go to the small business
learning center at http://www.sba.gov/tools/sba-learning-center.
participating in sba eligibility monitoring initiatives. in order to ensure the integrity of the program, firms will be required to recertify their status and may be
subject to program examinations, proposed decertifications, or protests designed to verify eligibility, including:
sba requiring the concern to certify in writing under penalty of perjury that it continues to meet all the eligibility criteria of the hubzone program or
voluntarily decertify
sba requiring the concern to submit updated documentation, similar to the information and documents you provided for the firm to obtain initial certification,
in order to verify that it remains eligible for the program.
sba requiring the concern to demonstrate that it was eligible for the program both at the time of its initial offer and award of a hubzone contract.
sba making unannounced site visits to any or all of the concern's locations to verify the accuracy of any information provided to sba.
misrepresentation: by bidding on any federal solicitation that is set-aside or reserved only for hubzone sbcs or for which a hubzone preference will be applied,
the firm's submission of that offer is deemed to be a representation to the united states that the company is fully in compliance with the hubzone regulatory
requirements, and that there have been no material changes since it received the hubzone certification. any sbc found to misrepresent its hubzone
status in obtaining such an award may be subject to a range of civil or criminal penalties, treble damages under the false
claims act, and/or suspension or debarment from federal contracting.
how to get the most out of the program
although the firm's status as a certified hubzone sbc greatly improves its access to federal awards, this certification does not guarantee contract awards. your
ability to research opportunities and competitively bid on them will be the key to your success in this program. i recommend you utilize the following additional web
resources designed to help you maximize the program's benefits:
sba's government contracting classroom website at (http://www.sba.gov/gcclassroom) provides valuable information on federal contracting. please note
that while your concern was approved under the primary north american industry classification system (naics) code found in your firm's sam and dsbs
profiles, you may be awarded contracts under other naics codes. you may benefit from researching and identifying potential hubzone contracting
opportunities outside your profile's naics code.
sba's surety bond program website (www.sba.gov/osg) provides information on how to apply for an sba surety bond guarantee.
federal business opportunities (www.fbo.gov) serves as a central listing for federal procurement solicitations to the public.
thank you for contributing to us economic development
we wish you the best of luck as a hubzone certified concern - your success will help improve the economic future of the hubzone(s) in which the firm operates. if at
any time you have any questions about the program or how the sba may be able to support your business objectives, the hubzone office offers assistance via an
interactive conference call where we can respond to general questions and concerns in real-time. visit our website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone, for additional
information or contact the hubzone help desk at hubzone@sba.gov

dear mrs. forus:
on behalf of the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va), center for verification 
and evaluation (cve), i am writing to inform you that your application for reverification 
has been approved. diverse solutions group inc. will remain eligible to participate in 
veterans first contracting program opportunities with va as a verified service-disabled 
veteran-owned small business (sdvosb).
this verification is valid for three (3) years from the date of this letter. 
please retain a copy of this letter to confirm diverse solutions group inc.'s continued 
program eligibility in accordance with 38 code of federal regulation (cfr) § 74.12. 
you may reapply 120 days prior to your new expiration date by logging into 
https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/.
to promote diverse solutions group inc.'s verified status, you may use the 
following link to download the logo for use on your marketing materials and business 
cards: https://www.va.gov/osdbu/docs/cve_completed_s.jpg. in addition, please 
access the following link for information on next steps and opportunities for verified 
businesses:
http://www.va.gov/osdbu/verification/whatsnext.asp.
while cve has confirmed that diverse solutions group inc. is presently, as of 
the issuance of this notice, in compliance with the regulation, diverse solutions group 
inc. must inform cve of any changes or other circumstances that would adversely 
affect its eligibility. eligibility changes not reported to cve within 30 days could result in 
a referral to the office of inspector general (oig), a referral to the debarment and 
suspension committee, and the initiation of cancellation proceedings—all of which 
could result in diverse solutions group inc. being removed from the vip verification 
program.

please be advised all verified businesses may be required to participate in one or 
more post-verification audits at cve's discretion. additionally, this letter and other 
information pertaining to diverse solutions group inc.'s verification application may be 
subject to freedom of information act (foia) requests. however, foia disclosures 
include exceptions regarding the personal privacy of individuals, and va policy similarly 
provides limitations on the release of individuals records.
if diverse solutions group inc. receives a negative size determination from the 
u.s. small business administration (sba), cve must act in accordance with 38 cfr § 
74.2(e). also note, if at any time diverse solutions group inc. discovers that it fails to 
meet the size standards for any naics code(s) listed on its vip profile, cve requires 
such naics code(s) be removed within five (5) business days. if these naics codes 
are not removed within the allotted five (5) business days, cve may request sba 
conduct a formal size determination. in addition, cve may initiate a referral to oig, a 
referral to the debarment and suspension committee and pursue cancellation 
proceedings. all of the aforementioned referrals and procedures could result in diverse 
solutions group inc. being removed from the vip verification program.
thank you for your service to our country and for continuing to serve america 
through small business ownership.

●
despite deployment of numerous security tools, organizations continue to be exploited through
vulnerable devices and services costing tens of millions of dollars per company per incident.
●
sixmap internet-wide assessments show organizations continue to expose vulnerabilities on ipv4
●
existing internet-wide capabilities scan just 3% of the ipv4 tcp attack surface (~2k ipv4 tcp ports)
●
ipv4 network services running on non-standard ports are more likely to be insecure
●
ipv6 adoption increased 34,000% over the last decade but traditional solutions cannot scan ipv6
●
every company that deploys ipv6 inherently increases their exposure risk:
○
stateless address autoconfiguration (slaac) enables devices to self-assign ipv6 addresses
○
network address translation (nat) does not protect devices on ipv6, allowing global access
○
firewalls and network intrusion detection systems are not adequately deployed on ipv6
sixmap
sixmap monitors 50x more of the network than traditional solutions and provides concise actionable
intelligence to reduce network security risk. sixmap is the only organization mapping ipv6 network-wide
and scans all 65,535 tcp ports on ipv4 and ipv6. sixmap also analyzes and prioritizes scan results so
defenders can triage problems and maximize risk reduction per man hour (e.g., sort cves by cvss or
subnets by attack surface and risk). analysts use sixmap’s platform to assess enterprise networks in
minutes and historical data enables security teams to verify risk reduction. sixmap uses adaptive
empirical analysis (aea) to iteratively interact with networks to discover devices, ports, and services.

moveone, inc. 
our partner moveone inc represents an entire network of agents that has provided international logistics, 
relocations and moving services for 25 years worldwide. moveone has provided support to countless us 
government contracts covering military, humanitarian aid, and energy sectors. with operations in eastern 
europe, the balkans, central asia, the middle east and the african region, moveone is an excellent partner 
with the resources as well as exceptional past performance to satisfy all in country requirements for those 
task orders set in the regions they serve.   
to satisfy the requirements of the contracts we support originating in the uae, sgl has partnered with 
moveone, a professional international freight forwarding firm, to ensure all levels of service are met. as an 
extension of sgl, moveone would provide the following services –  
 
ø export packing and crating – moveone specializes in custom packing and crating solutions to fit 
fluor’s unique cargo needs and prepare for shipping. 
ø containerizing – moveone specializes in the preparation of containers for ocean, rail, and highway 
transportation. moveone handles hundreds of containers per month, including standard, flat-racks and 
open-top, utilizing load plan programs. additionally, they have expertise in designing creative solutions 
for securing your cargo specific to the mode of shipping. 
ø freight consolidation, warehousing and project management – moveone is fully conversant with 
receiving, packing, inventory management and international freight forwarding activities, currently 
providing a similar service supporting logcap iv. their understanding of the process from contingent 
receipt to acceptance is up to date, as is their familiarity with the various management reports 
associated with receiving and packing activities e.g. daily receiving, os&d, mrr, on-hand and out-
bound reports. this ensures that they are eminently qualified and competent to handle and track the 
progress of project material through staging facilities and readiness to mobilize assets for material 
dispatches as and when requested 
ø warehouse and storage - all freight not requiring immediate shipping is stored at moveone’s facility. 
indoor storage is provided for materials requiring covered-space or outside if not required.  designated 
storage area for fluor will be provided as requested / required. 
ø imr receiving - before fluor’s cargo is received in the warehouse a physical and visible check of all 
pieces (e.g., cartons, bundles, skids, etc.) is made to ensure the material was not received damaged. all 
pieces are then physically opened for inspection. once material is received, all freight is weighed and 
located into proper location and is entered into moveone’s wms where the interim material receipt is 
created.  all pieces are then assigned a unique tracking number on the outside of the package for 
immediate identification and warehouse location.   
ø inventory inspections - all material received shall be subject to a three level inventory match against; 
the vendor’s packing list, the part numbers and other information given on the material itself, and the 
itemized po. during inspection moveone shall ensure that there is a complete match in all of the 
above. all boxes or containers shall be opened and a physical count/inspection made of every piece to 
confirm full conformity with what was actually ordered per the specifications identified within the po. 
verified items shall be marked off on the packing list as received. 
ø equipment – moveone is fully outfitted with lifting, pulling, hoisting equipment to appropriately 
handle cargo well over 10,000 lbs. all warehouse staff are fully trained and experienced on the proper 
use of this equipment. any special equipment required for oversized / heavy cargo can be leased and / 
or rented quickly, to ensure no interruption in loading and or off-loading procedures.

telephone:  +1.703.880.6606 | fax:   +1.703.552.2281 
 
ø automated warehouse management system – the crucial role played by a comprehensive, high-
quality warehouse management system (wms) cannot be over-estimated and is fully appreciated by 
moveone. from receiving, inventory control, order fulfilment to dispatch, our wms has been a 
significant factor in maintaining and improving the efficiency of our warehouse operations. moveone 
employs a dual web / android based application (which can be installed on handheld devices) for 
monitoring stock status, inbound and outbound management, stock in / out reporting. the system 
can easily be made compatible with other applications, e.g. purchasing or freight tracking systems, by 
our in-house it team, who have responsibility for its maintenance and further development. 
the integrated wms / freight tracking system may be remotely accessed via moveone’s corporate 
web portal by use of user-name and password based log-in and, therefore, material information is 
retrievable by multiple users 24 hours a day year-round. information such as vendor name, po 
number, promised delivery date, actual and late delivery will be available and easily extractable. 
ø project management - a senior member of our proposed project team will be assigned to the role of 
expediting manager and will bear responsibility for execution of all expediting activities which shall 
include but not be limited to -  liaise directly with the material vendor, visiting their premises as 
necessary, to ensure promise dates are met with a view to achieving on time delivery exceeding 90%,  
communicate directly with sgl and fluor’s departments regarding action items, review and update 
material status and expediting reports in a manner that is acceptable per fluor’s specific 
requirements, continually review and, subject to sgl and fluor's approval, refine plans as 
appropriate. the designated in country account manager shall ensure that a 24 hour, 7 days a week, 
365 days a year service is available to fluor. 
ø safety – it is moveone’s commitment and policy to ensure all employees and partners undergo a 
vetting process. moveone employs a strict adherence to ethics and integrity in business, requiring 
employees to undergo in house training and partners to have existing hs&e policies as well as business 
ethics policies with yearly training procedures.

“the big easy has its 
swagger back”
the queen of gospel headlined 
the first jazz festival 
mahalia jackson returned to her hometown 
to make an appearance at the first-ever new 
orleans jazz & heritage festival. attendees 
bubbled with excitement as jackson 
spontaneously joined a parade of second 
line revelers and sang alongside the iconic 
eureka brass band. many people went on to 
believe that this moment birthed the spirit 
of jazz fest - a meeting of jazz and heritage. 
fifty years later, the queen of gospel’s spirit 
continues to live on through her influence on 
music and authenticity.

caesars horseshoe casino baltimore – fundamental cx and combined heat 
and power (chp)
edison was contracted by the project’s leed consultant to provide 
leed commissioning services for the caesar’s horseshoe casino 
project in baltimore, md. the $442 million-dollar project is a luxury 
casino in baltimore, md totaling 340,000 square feet, approximately 
110,000 of which is a gaming floor.  the developers wanted to 
promote long term, life cycle cost value by ensuring the energy 
systems were all commissioned for operational excellence. the 
project included three 1000-ton premium efficiency chillers, fiver 
variable speed vertical inline pumps, three cooling towers, a water 
to water heat exchanger, five boilers and 1,200kw combined heat 
and power plant (chp). it was edison energy’s team goal to ensure the building’s overall performance was 
optimized by including energy-efficient design features and directly addressing issues like equipment 
performance, testing, system integration, building efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and comfort; building staff 
members were well-trained and possessed the documentation they needed to operate and maintain the 
buildings’ systems and equipment after turnover; any identified issues were resolved through the commissioning 
process, not just reported. the edison team performed a review of documentation related to the combined heat 
& power system (i.e., tab reports, start-up sheets, control documentation) and was responsible for 
development and distribution of pre-functional performance tests and functional performance tests. 
commissioned by our mid atlantic team with oversite by doug millar, horseshoe casino is one of the only leed 
gold casinos in the country, and in march of 2015, the horseshoe casino baltimore was awarded the president’s 
choice award at the usgbc maryland chapter’s 10th annual wintergreen awards for excellence in green 
building.

musk gives nasa tour to president barack obama.jpg, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/., who let him 
into nasa & us military rocket launches. how many jobs has musk given the black community-il?? 
 *  black employees are just 4% of tesla inc’s usa’ leadership &10% of its total us workforce.   
 * tesla racism suit shows musk’s willingness to take on regulators. california agency alleged 
“pervasive racism” at tesla’s plant. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/, feb 2022 
*  lack of diversity in tech 'is a 400-year problem, it won't be fixed overnight': per strategist, 
9/4/2020<deutsche bank> 
 * the plan to use 80% imported lithium with tesla-musk as a china-trojan horse is a simple device 
to loot usa & further impoverish us miners---massive transfer of us wealth & miner jobs to china 
 
musk builds car plants in 
india, germany & china 
how many in chicago??  
 
i, a jamaican immigrant & us citizen, personally met boeing’s chief tech officer circa yr 2002---chicago engineers had hoped 
boeing would bring lots of hi-tech jobs as president obama gave them the $40 billion air force tanker job <airbus’ bid was 
better> & $40 billion indonesia aircraft supply job. how many jobs have boeing brough chicago/illinois?   
 
we in the usa must step back & critically analyze our, <collective> performance, without regard to political affiliations, on the 
global stage, in terms of: 
  *  economic/mercantile prowess/agility * technology innovation * quality of life <healthcare, education, inclusion etc.> * 
national strategic security/robust defense apparatus 
china in yr 2020 garnered $2.7 trillion global sales, in the face of covid & imposed us tariffs and although china has earned 
global scorn over unethical/unlawful trade practices, that level of economic performance cannot all be attributed to ‘caprice’. 
 
biden admin seems enarmored by lithium imported materials--can lithium replace us coal jobs? 
 we applaud biden admin for demonstrated efforts to effect responsible usa carbon management, however, the proposed route 
via evs relies on 80% imported lithium from foreigners. the 1974 opec oil embargo shocked us national security-economy.   
 
biden administration outlines key resources to invest in coal and power plant community economic revitalization 
“…included the initial recommendations from the interagency working group to catalyze economic revitalization, create good-
paying, union jobs, and support workers in energy communities – hard-hit coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities – 
across the country. see: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/23/fact-sheet-biden--coal-
and-power-plant-economic-revitalization/ 
 
   biden orders u.s. to stop financing new carbon-intensive projects <whose greenhouse gas intensity is above a threshold 
lifecycle value of 250 grams of carbon dioxide/kwh & includes coal, gas or oil.>… the policy bans any u.s. government 
financing of overseas coal projects that do not capture or only partially capture carbon emissions, allowing federal agencies to 
engage on coal generation only if the project demonstrates full emissions capture…!!! see: 
www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-orders-us-stop-financing-carbon-intense-overseas-fuel-projects-2021-12-10/  
 
 the staggering proven quantities of us fossil fuel reserves begs the need to confine carbon & downgrade foreign lithium 
usa w/globe’s largest coal reserves—23%, vs russia’s 15%, australia’s 14% & china’s 13%. us is world’s lng export boss 
with such prodigious energy quantities, transparent-lawful-economic systems, usa should be the globe’s manufacturing center 
 
   despite the biden administration’s wishes, coal won’t go away, https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/fossil-
fuels/coal/despite-the-biden-administrations-wishes-coal-wont-go-away/ 
  parts shortages, high gas prices weigh on u.s. auto market yr 2022 
    india's annual coal output up 8.6%, supply up 18.4% 
 *  europe's energy crisis sends shockwaves through germany's industrial heart 
* the biden admin promised 550,000 charging stations, < costing taxpayers $50 billion> to help with the transition to evs ..”, 
see: www.local10.com/news/politics/2021/01/30/fighting-climate-change-in... how many us miners will get jobs in this 
large & risky outlay of tax dollars?? who/where gets first stations? what if ev sales falter---alternative use of charge stations? 
* toyota’s president, akio toyoda’s ominous prediction for what could lie ahead: ” if evs are adopted too quickly, we may not have 
the energy to support them at this point”. 
* china will eat our lunch, biden warns after clashing with xi on most fronts, feb 12, 2021----yet musk is supporting china! 
* top u.s., japan officials say china behavior inconsistent with international order  
environment: * overcharged batteries eyed in boeing dreamliner fires - jan 2013 * govt-run battery-powered plane crashes 
in norway, au 2019. *  ev batteries slow charging, drains 2-3% power/month & 50% in weather extremes, overweight & costly  
* china mastered complex arts of high-quality jet engines & now penetrating german markets @ 50% price of ge, rolls-royce,

the latter energy densiy metrics also describe energy physics-partitioning of engine systems.  how diesel 
/gasoline, turbines partition energy. lithium batteries are deadend/deadweight anachronistic to 21 st. century. 
enercon’s proprietary design suggests the ideal engine system must use closed loop, high pressure/lo 
temperature & water as motive propellant. *  lithium manufacture emits 74% more co2 than ic  equivalent.

simcha chamberg, jamaica-born/us citizen, founder/president/chief architect of 100% african american, 
enercon technologies, 1985, chicago, il. trained educated in jamaica, london u, norway, switzerland & 
usa is both electrical and mechanical engineer with a lifetime in energy & propulsion. simcha spent the 
last 20 yrs in 100% self/risk funded, proprietary research into zero emission systems based on 
power/energy extraction from detonation-combustion sciences and closed off/confining, self-healing 
reactors using nano-coal/metal/lng/biomass fuels & use clathration, carbonation sciences to confine co2 
* simcha chamberg only understands physics-engineering-lawful connections & is a politics dummy! 
* if a municipal project is ‘shovel ready’ in our climate-ravaged era, it is likely to need ‘future proofing’---robust risk analysis & 
quantitative research will be needed to stay afloat. carbon is not the enemy <the human frame is of carbon & we exhale co2>-
---should we all stop breathing? we need to manage atmospheric carbon concentrations. musk-china-foreign lithium is a scam! 
 
 *  we posit we can employ nano-coal-metals-minerals and any combustible materials, oil, lng, biomass in mobile or 
stationary modules, rated 200 hp to 1000mwe. for autos, suvs, heavy long-distance trucks, heavy rail, refrigerated containers, 
ocean going ultra large container ships, vtol planes to 40,000 ft altitude, with zero emission.  
* simcha chamberg, visited/counseled with sandia nuclear weapons facility, los alamos nuclear weapons facilities, kirtland 
nuclear afb all in new mexico. also, aberdeen weapons &amp; indian head weapons in md for counseling…our london 
university polytechnic-woolwich had extensive connections with woolwich arsenal, famous ww2 weapons facility… 
 * we paid extra attention to potential application to us military, 21st century needs as in battlefield mobility of m1-battle tanks, 
vtol aircraft-eliminating the self-destructing rotor craft, reducing thermal signature of us military machinery, ship-to-hostile 
shore, littoral connectivity, making mil-equipment survivable, terrain independent. 
*  simcha chamberg posed questions to high level us energy & weapons policy makers: 
a. if renewables are so cheap why is china, the world’s largest solar, wind & hydro-electric dam maker, using so much coal? 
how is china’s middleman, elon musk promoting china’s interests, contrary to pres biden’s policy. musk got his start from pres 
obama, but musk builds plants in china… no plants in minority us areas 
b. 
lockheed martin built the f-35 fighter <@$150 million ea.> now reporting cracked turbine blades & failed engines, in a 
$1.5 trillion program. lockheed martin also built failed littoral ships that broke down before reaching asia. still gets big $federal.  
 
fundamental thermal flaws haunting existing gas turbines that enercon has proprietary solutions for 
 
.nasa-caltech shows 
bankruptcy of gas 
turbines… *  no performance

page3/4 enercon tech zero emission fossil fueled prime mover. not for public release 
some major projects completed in jamaica & usa 
 
what is enercon proposing to jv with illinois coal producers? 
the usa is responsibly in a hurry to “decarbonize”, however a great industrial nation as usa, with vast 24/7 energy needs, 
simply has no proven/risk adjusted path to ‘decarbonization’ without major disruptions to a world-class economy. china’s vast 
production & fabrication capability <with the world’s largest solar, wind turbine, world’s largest dams etc.>, still cannot shake 
off massive coal usage.  
   china-asia dominates global ev & lithium battery production, has scaled up early & massively 
   in china the top selling ev, the wuling-mini,< 4-seater/110 mile range & geared for export to developing countries>, goes for 
$5,600.00 <vs tesla low-end us auto $46,000.00 and us per capita income, yr 2020 at $33,740.800 > and careful analysts see a 
replay of !980s takeover of us auto markets by asian makers: toyota, honda, <& vw?> started out with mass-market/forward 
price/low styling manufacturing vs higher priced, heavier-flashier us brands. yr 2022 sees toyota, vw, honda pushed out usa 
makers in the global space and also in the domestic us market. 
  tesla autos are for the well-heeled/upscale & bears slight relevance to us per capita wages and flies in the face of great us 
sage, henry ford: “make cars that the autoworkers can afford”, china’s 30% of global ev market & europe 20% outstrips the 
usa. the wild card in ev growth is the risk-adjusted rate of build-out of charging stations. 
  the chicken & the egg: how fast/who pays the up-front $50 billion, recharging infrastructure, without which ev growth is 
stymied. if ev growth lags charge station investments, what alternate use for charge stations? this writer has not seen this question 
posed anywhere, just pie-in-the sky ev dreaming. 
   with all the hype, lithium batteries, cannot handle heavy trucking & rail-the twin backbones of us economic prowess. il must 
build on gravitas, stay away from the auto-beauty shops & use il-usa fossil fuels & raw materials, to build 21st century zero 
emission fueling & engine innovations to sell globally. the secret is: usa is globe’s #1 lng exporter & has big coal reserves.

page4/4 enercon tech zero emission fossil fueled prime mover. not for public release 
usa must rethink global economic-national security strategies & dominate global energy markets 
the current fault lines have been exposed & show the tight nexus between energy & national security. europe’s almost infantile 
& careless reliance on russian energy emboldened russia military adventure, resulting in many lives lost, millions of refuges & 
destructions of whole cities & worse???. 
   usa must see eu as a wholly american energy-zero emission-engine market. without a zero emission engine strategy, 
usa will be at the mercy of low-priced russian <qatar, saudi etc,> energy as that is all russia has to sell to earn hard currency 
& to make weapons. command economies like russia & china have no ‘bottom’….china products & russian energy are on 
constant fireside sales, with their own citizens living in sub-standard conditions, 21st century slaves with tv sets & cell phones.  
  it sounds good to talk about the demise of fossil fuels & the rise of renewables. big industrial economies need 24/7, vast 
quantities of reliable energy. let us put the renewables in actual place before rhetoric overtakes reality. usa reality is abundant 
domestic fossil energy and vast ocean-coastlines teeming with potential clean water & minerals to be responsibly extracted. 
  
  n.h. <usa> coal plant will run through at least 2025 after latest grid auction 
russia raises stakes in energy standoff insisting on rubles for gas; yr 2021 saw 36% russia govt revenues from oil & gas 
poland rethinks the role of ng as it transitions away from coal-energy & avoid russian fuel dependence. lithuania becomes first 
eu state refusing russian gas imports. macron wants complete stop of coal & oil exports from russia to eu after bucha ""crimes""  
 *  coal still at heart of china energy strategy after parliamentary gathering, china earned $2.7 trillion global sales yr 2020 
 *  future proofing the environment in the face of energy scarcity & price volatility 
 * eu set to outlaw combustion engines within two decades * japan gets 30% of its electricity from coal--has no phase out plans  
which eu countries are most dependent on 
russian gas? <could help usa select partner to 
develop coal innovations

we are summit technology, inc., manufacturer of powersight® power loggers and power 
quality analyzers. we are a certified small business by the state of california department of 
general services. our products, powersight® power analyzers, are easy-to-use, compact power 
testing instruments that provide electrical testing professionals with just about anything they 
want to know about power or power quality. powersight® analyzers and accessories are our 
passion and focus. they are all we make.  
 
in this capability statement, we present the key competencies and differentiators of our 
company, in addition to some past performance examples. we would like to take a moment, 
however, to emphasize and elaborate on four important points about what makes us the ideal 
power analyzer source for any organization, government, agency, company, or institution. 
 
we have the best value analyzers and the lowest cost of ownership in the industry. we 
achieve these superlatives through our unique warranties and maintenance plans. all analyzers 
come with a 1-year warranty, which can be extended at the time of purchase as well as 
reinstated at any time throughout the life of the analyzer. they can even be retroactively 
reinstated, so you can send a meter in for repair after it’s had issues. the warranties include 
firmware updates, yearly calibrations, bug fixes, and more (more details here). some users 
have our analyzers for 15+ years because we build them to last and service them to become 
like-new for a low price–indefinitely. 
 
we have the widest range of accessories and operating ranges, ensuring your success in 
analyzing any source or load anywhere in the world. this includes direct connect to 4160v 
motors, 12.5kv distribution, 2000a dc transit, and much, much more. 
 
we have unique features and accessories to minimize errors and increase efficiency 
throughout the monitoring process. wizards check connections, aid setup, and write reports. 
our analyzers are the only ones that can have the entire test plan loaded into them for error-free 
efficient logging, according to plan. 
 
in addition to selling, we have possibly the largest rental stock of power analyzers in north 
america. being a small business doesn’t stop us from maintaining a fleet of hundreds of 
analyzers for rent. we take long and short-term rental orders of up to 100 analyzers, and we 
have money-saving solutions when you rent longer or purchase the equipment after renting. 
learn more here.  
 
our responsive, domestic technical support is knowledgeable and reachable. during business 
hours (m-f, 8am-5pm pst), we answer technical support calls from users in the field. no 
robots, no tedious phone menus; just great, fast service provided in-house.  
 
we are experienced, proven, and work with you to achieve your goals. over the years, we have 
done business with all us military branches, the federal government, us embassies, local 
governments, utilities, universities, and more. references can be provided upon request. we 
pivot quickly and always focus on crafting the right solution for your unique situation.  
 
our job isn’t done until your job is successful!

revealed an 85%-plus ""strongly agree"" that all goals, objectives, desired 
outcomes, and johnson's teaching style, were exemplary. this course is a 
key component of co-hort 1 as we roll out a new leadership curriculum for

anne arundel medical center
the keynote address given by kevin johnson at our martin luther king, jr. 
day was inspirational, thought-provoking and motivational. johnson 
inspired us with the words of dr. king regarding using love to combat the 
eﬀects of injustice and using our god-given talents to ""do something"" rather 
than idly standing by. he gave us practical ways to organize our thoughts, 
set priorities and establish clear goals. when johnson concluded his 
presentation, i felt encouraged that even in my small way in my community 
i can make a signi�cant diﬀerence.

our executive leadership team underwent coaching from mr. kevin johnson 
of the johnson leadership group from august 2020 to march 2021. mr. 
johnson’s approach consisted of easy-to-follow exercises and discussions. 
through his process, the team learned about self-awareness, how to 
constructively empower each other and our teams, eﬀective communica-
tion, and more. his coaching has helped us to remember to take our time to 
pause and re�ect, reminded us of the importance of self-care in personal 
and professional growth, and taught our team how we can better support 
each other in reaching our highest potential and to be more eﬀective in our 
roles. i recommend coaching through the johnson leadership group to 
anyone looking to maximize their personal and professional potential.

overview of jw photography 
creates web based applications (browser based software) of 360° walkthroughs. high resolution 
360° images are captured on site, edited and stitched into equirectangular panoramas. all images 
are retouched to remove the appearance and shadow of the camera, photographer or other 
persons and ppi within the tour. 3d tour is programmed to have custom elements throughout the 
space to engage the user in interacting in their surroundings.  
software and tools 
though we have used matterport, the customization offered in the 3d vista software is superior. 
it provides a full open source file code (which may be white labeled to remove all photographer 
and software logo and branding), can be hosted on servers such as aws east, aws govcloud 
(both of which we act as csp) and analytics tracked. the customizations we are offering are 
superior to matterport in the following ways: 
the images are programmed to connect with our custom created icons (dots, arrows, logos or 
animated icons) to show the user which direction to navigate. we can capture images at the best 
view for the user (unlike matterport needing close 
images for connecting algorithm during capture, 
matterport requires movement between captures to me 
no more than 5-8 feet). all post production connections 
make the user feel as they have 3d dynamic 
movement, while seeing the best view of the space and 
objects. 
custom menus are created to give the user added information, showcase images from the space, 
display logos, embed or open new tab for website, call/ email buttons, download pdf 
photogrammetry of objects can be included with an iframe in the tour, user would click to enable 
a 3d model that can be manipulated and turned.  
lidar scanning can create a floorpan for the space. as well full 3d models can be custom created 
by our modeling team to have the user open in a digitally rendered space, but navigate a 
walkthrough done in physical images. 
many tours can be grouped together in a virtual showcase as we have done with multi-building 
facilities tours can be made fully ada section 508 complaint.  
experience:  
our team has had experience in creating 360 immersive tours for different industries, with many 
custom tours of homes. we have created virtual experiences in a 360 virtual rendered 
environment created from blender and unity software. we are able to capture images indoors as 
well as outdoors, and have experience with reflective surfaces (an area where the matterport 
camera struggles to get a capture). our current team can handle a workload of 10 tours a week, 
with a turn around time of 2 weeks for live hosted link delivery. our team is available to travel 
on site for capture of images. 
though new to government contracting we have created tours for the united states army corps 
of engineers at the rock island arsenal mississippi river visitors center. a project which 
showcases our ability to entwine the history of the lock and dam system and ability to use 
interactive educational trivia and downloadable resources. 
examples of tours: 
museum tour with 3d model, i spy and trivia game.

improvements to the 2020 virtual village 
menu format and ui can remain the same or be upgraded to have different elements for the user. 
using 3d vista as the only software allows a more seamless flow for the user between the main 
page of the virtual village with rendered exteriors of the properties. as well as remaining in the 
main viewer, unlike matterport opening in a web frame. 
e-learning within the 3d vista tour program can be used to showcase pop-up scavenger hunt 
questions within the tour, unlike the 2020 scavenger hunt which had the user open a second page 
for a pdf.  
each virtual home will have a 3d model designed uniquely for each tour and models will be 
aligned in a “village” format. the user will be able to walk freely between properties and 
navigate the space. we suggest less 3d modeled people, they do not offer any engaging 
interaction for the user and are a distraction to the tour. instead we would offer informational pop 
ups of the challenge and teams within the tour (also will be accessible through the menu). 
embedded video, projected images and pdf files call all be accessed within the tour. providing 
clickable and engaging content is the key to ensuring the user remains and interacts on the site.  
virtual reality functionality is not fully operational on the 2020 tour. this is due to the skin 
elements not being compatible in vr and causes the user to not see the home or be able to enter 
the matterport tour. we will create a fully functioning virtual reality version of the tour, 
allowing the user to enter each home and tour freely.  
 
sample images from the 2020 solar decathlon tour in vr on a mobile device (homes missing, 
user not able to enter tour).

federal agencies get 
credit for the amount of 
work they issue to an 8(a).
sole-source contracting is 
less complex and more 
time efficient.  a formal 
rfp is not required.
without the need to post 
an rfq or rfp, working 
directly with the 8(a) firm 
is more cost-effective.
51% of the firm is owned by a us 
citizen that are socially and 
economically disadvantaged who 
are of good character that 
demonstrate potential for success.
congress shows vested interest in 
the 8(a) program because of its 
effects on minority-owned & 
small businesses overall role in 
job creation.
applicants must be classified as a 
small business according to the

 intellichain is a decentralized based blockchain system which relies strongly upon the 
utilization and separation of either single instance of the public or private key within the public 
key infrastructure, encryption and decryption methodologies and secure identity management. 
current methodologies regarding public key infrastructure are prevalent in modern computer 
systems and widely used for authentication and authorization processes seeded within business 
logic of applications. the storage methodologies are typically built within a centralized system 
which are susceptible to a multitude of security issues inherently. additionally, this provides an 
attackable surface which has been the leading cause of data breaches that are prevalent in the

project description: usaf afrl sbir sttr application development, cyber security, cloud 
security, architecture and migration, infrastructure support, program management, and 
business operations 
 
the project deliverables within the sole-source contract were to maintain and update the state of 
the usaf sbir/sttr system to plan, schedule and deploy a fully functional test, qa, and 
production fedramp certified cloud saas solution. our team successfully met the challenge 
and deployed three fully functional provisional authority to operate (p-ato) fedramp 
authorized environments (test, qa, production) for the usaf afrl sbir sttr program 
before project deliverable deadline date.  upon successfully migrating the sbir sttr 
application from the usaf afrl data center located on 
 
wright patterson air force base, dayton ohio to the cloud, we provided the following services 
to maintain and support the new sbir sttr software as a service (saas) application. 
 
business operations and program management services: 
 
www.steathentry.com 
 
5 | p a g e  
 
stealth entry business operation support team supported the af sbir/sttr pmo to facilitate 
an effective, efficient, and user-friendly system throughout the life cycle of the af sbir/sttr 
grant process, from topic generation to contract award management. our personnel faithfully 
implemented the af sbir/sttr operations manual and conducted periodic reviews of the 
manual and updated as requested by the af sbir/sttr pmo to accommodate current 
processes and emerging requirements. 
 
our personnel provided expert data management and reporting services, including but not 
limited to, annual reports, quarterly reports, monthly reports, and custom ad hoc data reports for 
the community and pm. this benefited the pmo and other stakeholders by maximizing visibility 
into the af sbir/sttr program and business processes. stealth entry successfully gathered 
and documented af sbir/sttr pmo it and/or data requirements, furthering broad program 
goals such as maintaining a pipeline of small businesses engaged in research and development to 
enhance the capabilities of the warfighter. in addition to managing, tracking, and gathering pmo 
requirements, stealth entry business operations support team successfully translated 
requirements, where applicable, into technical or process solutions, addressing resources 
required, estimated completion date, and risks. 
 
other services stealth entry provided to the af sbir/sttr pmo include assisting in the 
development of alternative application hosting solutions, managing, and updating the 
infrastructure operations manual as directed by the ccb. our pm was available to accompany 
the af sbir/sttr infrastructure manager in af sbir/sttr business meetings, conferences, 
and training. 
 
stealth entry help desk staff successfully coordinated with the af sbir/sttr community to 
ensure data is accurate and up to date in the af sbir/sttr system, to include ensuring name 
changes to offices, command structure, or other embedded identifiers. our personnel maintained 
and updated a comprehensive frequently asked questions (faqs) tool for the af sbir/sttr 
community. stealth entry also developed comprehensive training materials, written and on-line, 
on how to use the af sbir/sttr system for different types of audiences within the af 
sbir/sttr community. our personnel brought, current, relevant experience training to the end 
users via web-based and classroom training. our personnel ensured the upload of data from 
external sources to the af sbir/sttr system was completed as outlined in the iom. 
 
stealth entry provided operational process support to assist with the sbir/sttr cycle 
requirements and alignment of the af sbir/sttr system, as well as additional administrative 
support for the af sbir/sttr infrastructure operations program as directed by our 
government project representative. 
  
cyber security operations: 
 
stealth entry lead, planned, deployed, and supported the program management office (pmo) in 
migrating the sbir sttr application to a fedramp approved il4 saas / paas cloud solution. 
stealth entry’s technical support followed a formal cloud migration process that is currently 
identified as best practice by cloud standards organizations such as the national institute of 
standards and technology (nist) and the cloud standards customer council (cscc). it was a 
www.steathentry.com

requirement for the dod that the hosted cloud provider that was chosen to be a certified 
fedramp approved cloud services provider. stealth entry is a fedramp approved cloud 
services provider, and we ensured that the cloud environment we provided for the sbir/sttr 
application had a minimum-cyber security standard that has been audited and met to meet the 
necessary compliance for certification. 
 
stealth entry successfully maintained the security and privacy of the sbir/sttr infrastructure, 
by having our cyber security technical experts perform vulnerability and patch management to 
ensure that all assets have all up to date security patches installed. our cloud security architects 
lead and collaborated with the usaf afrl rd information assurance personnel, and the pmo 
in obtaining a cloud provisional authority to operate (p-ato) by performing the proper 
processes identified within the risk management framework (rmf) to capture that the 
appropriate security controls must be in place, and that those controls are performing the 
functions as expected to maintain compliance with the official ssp and c&a system of record. 
 
stealth entry provided the af sbir/sttr pmo services to maintain the infrastructure / 
datacenter housing the af sbir/sttr system. these services include everything from 
managing routers, switches, and servers to conducting backups, configuring, and hardening 
system assets to security standards, troubleshooting network connectivity, and ensuring the 
application had the resources to work properly. stealth entry personnel also tracked hardware 
inventory and managed software licenses. we registered all licenses, subscriptions, assets, and 
services used by the datacenter. stealth entry personnel met the af sbir/sttr infrastructure 
programs goal for these services, infrastructure, and applications: 99% availability to the af 
sbir/sttr community, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with minimal to no interruptions. 
 
stealth entry applied our performance management approach to network and enterprise 
infrastructure with the objective of continuously achieving 99.9% availability of the system and 
infrastructure. continuity of operations (coop) was critically important, and any system 
changes required backup of existing data. we implemented a complete backup of all data before 
starting any updates or changes. stealth entry's cyber threat intel analysts managed and 
monitored boundary defenses of the infrastructure as defined in the c&a documentation. we 
maintained all infrastructure assets up to date with the latest approved security patches releases 
and disa stigs. 
 
application maintenance: 
 
 
stealth entry application maintenance methodology (amm) combines cmmi best practices in 
change management with project, risk, release, configuration, and deployment management 
processes. we integrated these functions to manage the sbir/sttr applications (public and 
private) maintenance from origination of an incident (incident or change request) through 
remediation, testing, and deployment of the changes into the production environment. stealth 
entry followed a structured process towards application maintenance to adequately capture and 
report resolution of support requests. our amm goes beyond merely managing and optimizing 
applications. our portfolio-based, consultative approach takes a holistic view of technology, 
information architecture, people, and services. we took the time to understand the business 
domain supported by the application, technology roadmap, processes, and applications, then 
www.steathentry.com 
 
7 | p a g e  
 
optimize and align team structures to deliver improved application support. when delivering 
application maintenance support to our usaf sbir sttr customer, our objective was to 
minimize downtime and volatility. we ensured the sbir/sttr applications stayed optimally 
geared to provide rapid responses to critical change requests and business requests. we also 
looked at application and feature redundancies and business-criticality of the applications when 
planning for application maintainability. 
 
stealth entry used agile and cmmi best practices, application change requests are documented 
as user stories and prioritized for most efficient and impactful release of updates to the 
application. every user story is completed and deployed on a predictable schedule ensuring that 
the resulting application is stable and in full compliance with all dod application security 
mandates and compliance. 
 
stealth entry also provided data analytics and sharepoint administration. our personnel 
successfully provided data management and reporting services, to include but not limited to, 
annual reports, quarterly reports, and custom data reports as requested by our government 
customer. our resources were able to analyze and consolidate multiple sources of data, provide 
reports and metrics, and create ad-hoc reports in excel or access, and integrate data analytics 
results within the af sbir/sttr requirements. stealth entry personnel successfully created and 
maintained custom forms, pages, views, and workflows, and consolidated multiple air force 
research laboratory and small business sites in one site 
 
fedramp cloud architecture and cloud security 
 
stealth entry successfully completed the program management office development of a cloud 
solution migration plan that migrated all the web applications within sbir/sttr infrastructure 
to a fedramp – dod il4 hosted cloud solution selected by the pmo. stealth entry performed 
the migration of the sbir/sttr applications to our hosted cloud provider in a strategic and 
methodical manner. the applications were thoroughly assessed with the support of the program 
management office to understand what considerations much be addressed, to include costs of the 
migration, application performance and potential modification of any applications, in order for a 
successful cloud migration to take place.  
stealth entry is an authorized microsoft azure govcloud cloud service provider for core 
technology components of iaas, paas and saas.  our organization follows a formal migration 
process that is currently identified as best practice by cloud standards organizations such as the 
national institute of standards and technology (nist) and the cloud standards customer

business process improvement
durabante uses lean six sigma and design for six sigma (dfss) methodologies to 
improve and redesign processes to make them faster, better, and cheaper. we go one 
step beyond the traditional six sigma techniques by developing procedures, reference 
guides, and training to successfully control the improved processes and make them 
sustainable.
training, mentoring, and coaching
durabante’s training program is designed to meet the needs of today’s businesses with core 
offerings centered around communication, project management, and lean six sigma. our 
field experience keeps training relevant, understandable, and applicable. lessons learned 
can be applied immediately and successfully in the workplace. one-on-one mentoring is 
available as part of the training program, as well as a separate class for those that want to 
hone a particular skill.
procedure program development
durabante’s professional program and procedure management team develops  “human 
factored”  procedures and implements quality programs using procedure professional 
association guidelines. with the increased need to prove compliance and safety, 
standardization and procedures are crucial. incorporating  “human performance tools”  
such as  “peer checking”  and  “three-way communication”  with procedures that have 
been  “human factored”  for clarity greatly mitigates the potential for errors and injuries.

Applied Test Systems Llc,334516,Pennsylvania,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,https://www.atspa.com/,"Our History
Norman L. Carroll, Founder of Applied Test SystemsThe founder of ATS, Norman L. Carroll, is a Kansas native who spent 15 years working as a manufacturing engineer at the Westinghouse Atomic Fuel Division plant in Cheswick, Pennsylvania. This field presented a number of unique testing and quality control applications for which Norm was constantly struggling to find suitable equipment, including various ultrasonic, eddy current, radiographic, and destructive tests. When equipment could not be found, solutions often had to be developed in-house. This situation led to Norm’s departure from Westinghouse in order to create his company, called Applied Devices, in 1965.

""The Barn,"" the original Applied Test Systems manufacturing facilityA handful of employees initially worked in a refurbished barn that served as the company’s engineering, marketing, and manufacturing facility. In the beginning, the company’s foremost customer was the Westinghouse plant where Norm had been working. His thorough knowledge of the industry’s needs made Applied Devices an invaluable resource to that organization. As time went on, a standard line of products began to be developed, including universal testing machines, creep/stress rupture test frames, furnaces, and ovens, as well as an unmatched line of testing accessories. By far, however, the majority of projects continued to be unusual custom equipment which no one else would build, and the word quickly spread around the industry: This company can do almost anything.

Applied Test Systems todayAs business continued to grow, the name of the company was changed to Applied Test Systems (ATS) to more accurately describe the corporation’s specialty. It wasn’t long after that when ATS also began to sell outside of the United States. ATS continues to keep up with the ever-changing testing world by actively participating in numerous ASTM committees, and recently was awarded for their excellence in exportation.

“Applied Test Systems Quality Policy is to achieve sustainable and profitable growth by providing products and services which meet mutually agreed upon expectations of the customer 100% of the time.”"

Meltwater was founded in Oslo, Norway, in 2001. As the legend goes, the company started with only two men, a coffee machine, and $15,000 in startup capital. Our original address was Shack15, a little office space located in a shipyard in Oslo, where the team cobbled together borrowed hardware to create our first server farm. As the world's first online media monitoring company, the team worked tirelessly to educate the Norwegian market on the value of tracking, monitoring, and analyzing online news.

Our footprint began to grow in the early 2000s as the company's operations began expanding throughout Scandinavia, then the United Kingdom, and, eventually, Europe. After focusing our attention on conquering the United States, we set our eyes to Asia-Pacific. By 2008, we had a physical presence—and an impressive customer list—on every continent.

During this time, we became one of the first companies globally to offer social listening and social media analytics, and have consistently been at the forefront of innovation within our industry. Over the past five years, we completed eight acquisitions, earning us international recognition as one of the most prominent acquirers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science companies in the world.

Today, we are proud to have built Meltwater into a global company. We know many companies take a different path to growth, but we aren't like many companies. We are Meltwater, and we think that's what makes us unique. We hope you do, too"

Our History
Our story began out of a passion for people’s safety. Chainbridge Solutions President and CEO Aarti Smith is a Virginia Tech Hokie, and the tragedy that took place on April 16, 2007 had a profound impact on her and the way she viewed security. It led her to question how senseless tragedies such as this could have been prevented and those 32 lives spared.

These questions were still on her mind in 2010 when a new career opportunity presented itself and from it, Chainbridge Solutions™ was born. What began as a business focused on personnel security has since expanded, but kept people at the core – making lives safer, productive and enjoyable.

We provide value for you by reducing the time it takes you to qualify project opportunities.

Our Leadership
Leadership built and growing from a solid foundation
CEO Ed Lewis founded Industrial Info in 1983 and was able to attract effective and seasoned talent, including senior process engineers and plant managers that were taking early retirement due to cutbacks and layoffs brought about by the economic recession of the early 1980s. Together, they built the company's market research methodology and trained the junior staff members who are now part of IIR's leadership team. The company's current research leaders have extensive experience in their respective industries, and together represent more than 256 years of experience at Industrial Info.

Our Mission
Provide 'Best-in-Class' products and services to help our clients succeed
Industrial Info is built around the idea of helping both our clients and employees be as successful as possible.

For our clients, IIR's goal is to help build business legacies for years to come by providing ""best-in-class"" products and services. The frequency with which Industrial Info verifies its Global Market Intelligence ( IIRGMI™ ), coupled with our other quality-assurance and data-integrity principles, is called the Living Forward Reporting Principle™. This principle ensures that Industrial Info provides the most accurate and timely market intelligence on industrial spending throughout the world.

For our employees, Industrial Info strives to create a work environment in which our employees can learn, grow and be fulfilled in the work they do, as well as being recognized and compensated for their achievements. Creating a workplace of hard-working, loyal employees who care about the company and want to stay with IIR for a long time is absolutely essential to providing the best products and services to our clients.

Being honest and truthful when dealing with our clients and employees is the key element of Industrial Info's corporate philosophy: ""Say what you mean, mean what you say, and do what you say you mean.""

Who is Herman Miller?
Learn why Herman Miller has thrived for over 108 years.
Our Brands
We build these relationships with companies that, like us, are committed to high standards.

Learn More
Herman Miller was a West Michigan businessman who helped his son-in-law, D.J. De Pree, buy the Michigan Star Furniture Company in 1923. De Pree had been working at the company, which opened in 1905, since he was hired in 1909 as a clerk. De Pree knew his father-in-law was a man of integrity, so he decided to rename the company after him.

By the middle of the 20th century, the name Herman Miller had become synonymous with “modern” furniture. Working with legendary designers George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames, the company produced pieces that would become classics of industrial design.

Since then, we’ve collaborated with some of the most outstanding designers in the world, including Alexander Girard, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Propst, Bill Stumpf, Don Chadwick, Ayse Birsel, Studio 7.5, Yves Béhar, Doug Ball, and many talented others.

Today, in addition to our classic pieces and new designs for the home, Herman Miller is a recognized innovator in contemporary interior furnishings, solutions for healthcare environments, and related technologies and services. A publicly held company headquartered in Zeeland, Michigan, we have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom and sales offices, dealers, licensees, and customers in over 100 countries.

We operate through several focused businesses, brands, and distribution channels, including Herman Miller, Herman Miller Healthcare, Nemschoff, Geiger International, and independently owned dealerships. All of them work to design and build a better world around you."

MEET OUR SHAREHOLDER
The Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes
The Flathead Indian Reservation is home to three tribes, the Bitterroot Salish, Upper Qĺispe̓, and the Kootenai. The territories of these three tribes covered all of western Montana and extended into parts of Idaho, British Columbia, and Wyoming. The Hellgate Treaty of 1855 established the Flathead Reservation, but over half a million acres passed out of Tribal ownership during land allotment that began in 1904.

 

The subsistence patterns of our Tribal people developed over generations of observation, experimentation, and spiritual interaction with the natural world, creating a body of knowledge about the environment closely tied to seasons, locations, and biology. This way of life was suffused with rich oral history and a spiritual tradition in which people respected the animals, plants, and other elements of the natural environment. By learning from our Elders and teaching our children, those Tribal ways of life continue to this day.

Pittsburgh-based Imbue Technology Solutions, Inc. (“ImbuTec”) was formed in 2003. At its inception, the company focused on utilizing and deploying innovative technologies to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings. ImbuTec provided detailed analysis of the operation of commercial buildings, and ranked recommendations of energy conservation measures that could be implemented to reduce operating expenses.

Recognizing that lighting provides the biggest return on investment among energy conservation measures, the company later focused on providing energy-efficient lighting products and services to commercial, industrial, and municipal customers. ImbuTec was on the leading edge in the U.S. of the transition from conventional lighting systems to installation of energy-efficient LED lighting systems, which launched its role as an electrical contractor.

Over the years, the company has significantly expanded its capabilities by providing a wide diversity of construction services for a broad range of governmental, commercial, and institutional customers.  ImbuTec’s customer-centered approach has enabled it to build an outstanding track record for delivering high quality results to its customers with a high level of customer satisfaction. In addition, the company has an outstanding safety record, which reflects the care and concern it has for its customers, its employees and subcontractors, and the public at-large.  Today, ImbuTec operates as a full-service electrical and general construction firm.

ImbuTec is also certified as an 8(a) contractor by the U.S. Small Business Administration, and as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) by the Pennsylvania Unified Certification Program (13311), National Minority Supplier Development Council (PT 01525), and the Pennsylvania Department of General Services."

Global delivers the energy, products, and services people need every day to make life easier.


 

As one of the Northeast’s largest independent owners, suppliers, and operators of gasoline stations and convenience stores, reliability, quality, and community are key to everything we do.

We are proud to support the communities where we live and work. Our efforts to be a good neighbor began more than 75 years ago, when our company began delivering heating oil – door to door – in the neighborhoods around Greater Boston. These efforts continue through our active giving program, which enhances good works in communities across the country.

Today, Global owns, controls, or has access to one of the largest terminal networks in New England and New York.  We source and transport petroleum products and renewable fuels through our vertically integrated, adaptive distribution network across the U.S. and Canada. In addition, we are a leading wholesale distributor of petroleum products in New England and New York. Through our network, approximately 1M automobile tanks are filled per day. Customers stop at one of our gasoline stations to fill their tanks, recharge with a fresh cup of coffee, or grab a snack.

Our vertically integrated model gives us the unique ability to adapt when markets change, creating stability for our customers, all while conducting a business that’s been guided by family, with integrity and respect, since 1933.

Our history
More than 75 years ago, the company began with a single truck. In 1933, Abraham Slifka opened Slifky’s Reliable Oil Burner Service, delivering heating oil that provided warmth to Boston businesses and families during the Great Depression.

As America turned to heating oil from coal and other fuel sources, the company grew. The next generation, Slifka’s sons, Fred and Richie, expanded into wholesale fuel distribution and trading, buying their first terminal in Revere, Massachusetts, and eventually buying and storing heating oil and other products from all over the world.

During the 1980s and 90s, the company expanded into the retail gasoline business with the purchase of several chains throughout the Northeast. In 2005, founder Abraham Slifka’s grandson, Eric Slifka, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Partners LP.

Bob Garcia - (1950-2018) Founder and Past President and Chairman of the Board
In the 1960’s and early 70’s Bob worked in the building and bridges division for the railroad in Cheyenne, WY. During that time to earn extra income, he filled in for his brother Charles from time to time cleaning Mountain Bell buildings (now Lumen) for Varsity Contractors, Inc. He was soon recognized by Don Aslett,  the founder of Varsity,  as a go to employee and was enticed to make Varsity a full time career in 1974. Over the years, Bob grew with the company and held about every position in Don’s company. His wife Dianna also joined Varsity in 1979 and worked in various positions for the next 28 years. In 1992 Eric Luke, then a Vice-President for Varsity, offered Bob a chance of a life time;  to own and lead a Minority Contracting company. Originally named Varsity/Garcia,Inc., the name was later changed to System1,Inc.  to better reflect the scope of services.  Over the years, Varsity and Bob took that start up operation and turned it into a thriving company.

Robert Rayl - President/CEO, Board Member
From 1985 to 1998 Robert held various property management positions within Simon Property Group in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. In 1998 Robert joined Varsity Contractors, Inc., and was a shareholder through the acquisition of Kellermeyer Building Services. During his tenure with Varsity as an executive and owner, he managed the operations of Varsity’s facility maintenance and construction business which operated in the retail, education, and commercial sectors. Robert has over 35 years of experience in this industry. In 2014 while maintaining ownership and executive duties with Varsity, Robert was selected to be the President and CEO of System1, Inc., before being elected to the System1 board of directors in 2017. Robert continues to build upon the foundation set by Don Aslett’s Six Principles of business as he leads System1. It has withstood the test of time and is a true differentiator as he continues to build the company.  1. We love our customers. 2. We pioneer solutions. 3. We are all workers. 4. We love our people. 5 Willing to sacrifice. 6. We give the customer what they want.

In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his lovely wife and children.

Nathan Long - General Counsel, Shareholder
Nate is a shareholder of System1 Inc. Nate’s mentor in the law, Judge Boyle, always told him that “good lawyers solve problems.”

Ever since, he’s done just that, having served as an attorney, licensed conflict mediator, and general counsel for a multi-national company, of which he managed the HR & Risk Management Department.

Nate got his start in law as a staff attorney to Chief US Magistrate Judge Larry M. Boyle for the District of Idaho. He was part of a nationally recognized firm that represented a diverse array of clients and handled numerous litigations, including personal injury, indemnification, property damage, insurance coverage, and consumer protection claims.

During his time as general counsel, he assisted with nationwide contract disputes, workers’ compensation, product liability, and more. With many years of experience, Nate continues to show a passion for working with and managing minority-owned companies.

Our History
In 1992, Varsity Contractors through the leadership of Eric Luke (past Varsity CEO) and Robert Garcia (Long time Varsity Manager) formed an alliance and started a Minority Cleaning operation to service telecommunications, commercial and retail customers. They called this company Varsity Garcia. Robert and his associates, many of whom developed their skills with Varsity, built that start-up operation into a thriving total facilities services company. The cornerstone of its growth was a strong commitment to excellence in service and integrity. After several years of operation, the Board of Directors changed the name of the company to System1 to better reflect the scope of services they provide to their customers. Today, System1 operates throughout the country.

Don Aslett, the Founder of Varsity Facility Services in 1958, was and continues to be one of the pillars of System1. The values and the culture of System1 are a direct reflection of Don’s visions and his commitment to not only growing a company but more importantly growing people. Don has authored over 40 books and completed more than 6,000 seminars, workshops, and TV filming’s nationally and internationally. All of these relate to organization and the dimension of clean. Don continues to work in the industry as the Founder, Owner, and everyday Tour Guide of the Museum of CLEAN. (pictured right). Don, the KING of CLEAN, continues to be a valuable resource, inspiration, and visionary to System1 and our current leadership.

Our Values
Since the day System1 was founded, we have reinforced and consistently developed our company values to show our employees what we stand for regarding support, ethics, and upholding integrity. System1 is more than just a place to work or a means for profit. It is a place of purpose and a community of acceptance. We aim to go above the needs and expectations of our employees when needed most and ask for the same in return when delivering quality performance for our customers. We pride ourselves on nine core values that have existed since the beginning of our company and remain as a blueprint for our service standards.

We treat all people with the respect and dignity every human being deserves. This attitude prevails in our offices, in our workplaces, and in all our business relationships.

Our Country
The liberties and blessings and the great free enterprise system we enjoy stems from the Constitution of this great nation. We sustain and support those laws, efforts and activities that keep America strong and free.

Opportunity
We treasure the wealth of opportunity offered by this great nation. We defend the right of every individual to share in that opportunity equally regardless of race, sex, or creed.

Character
Our company is founded on principles of honesty, integrity, fairness, and high ethical standards. We are committed to maintaining these values, both as a company and as individuals.

Success
We believe in setting and achieving worthy and high objectives, both as a company and as individuals. Our objectives include sustained growth, fair profits, and a continuing corporate integrity.

Productive Work

History
Back in the 1980s, five young analysts were working together at a large firm in Washington, D.C. The work was challenging and meaningful, but the office environment was grim. So, the colleagues set out to found their own firm—one that would reward staff of all ages and seniority levels for their expertise.

Many of the firm’s original clients are still with us to this day, including the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. Two of Exeter’s first hires, Thomas Catlin and Steven Estomin, have since become our senior-most partners. Exeter Associates, Inc. is a leading energy, economics, and regulatory consulting firm. We provide our clients with innovative yet practical solutions to public policy, legal, and business issues.

The findings of an options study present a strategic road map for selecting the most economically efficient option that meets the needs of the client.

Forecasting
Long-term load forecasting is a critical function that is ever more valuable as regional markets evolve and capacity becomes more constrained. As generation assets become increasingly more expensive to construct, forecasting has become more critical as a means of ensuring the avoidance of excess capacity, which can serve to dramatically increase costs to ratepayers.

The company is also a Silver Patron Member.

The Utility Arborist Association (UAA) is a professional organization for individuals and companies with interest in and a commitment to the maintenance of trees and other vegetation. It is the leading North American organization for the enhancement of quality utility arboriculture and right-of-way vegetation management. Many Wright Tree Service employees are members of UAA and serve on the organization’s committees as volunteers. The company is also a sponsor of UAA.

The Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA) is the public and professional resource on trees and arboriculture, representing approximately 2,100 tree service and affiliated member companies. Many Wright Tree Service employees are Certified Treecare Safety Professionals (CTSPs) through TCIA, and the company is an Associate Member.

Our Business Partners
Wright Tree Service is a part of the Wright Service Corp. family of companies. Our sister companies include ArborCare, CNUC, Terra Spectrum Technologies, Sustainable Environmental Consultants, Spectrum Resource Group, Verdure Elements and Wright Outdoor Solutions. History

Our company’s history begins with John L. Wright, who founded Wright Tree Service in 1933. John began working in the tree industry in 1928 when he got a job with National Tree Company. When the company went out of business due to the Great Depression, John took a part-time job as a mail carrier at 60 cents per hour and continued to do tree work in his spare time. When his hours as a mail carrier were cut, John packed his suitcases, loaded a few tools worth about $20 into his secondhand car and, accompanied by his wife Harriet, took off for Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And so began Wright Tree Service.

Total sales for the first year were only $600. When work shut down altogether that winter, John and Harriet Wright spent time with family in Des Moines, Iowa. They decided to stay in Des Moines that spring, and the corporate office has been in the metro area ever since.

The early years were extremely difficult, but work picked up enough in the spring of 1936 for John to purchase an ad in the phone book for the first time. John and Harriet now had a family, so he supplemented his income as a railway mail clerk. In 1938, the business had grown enough for John to quit his part-time job and focus solely on his tree work.

In 1940, Wright Tree Service acquired its first utility line clearance job with Iowa Power and Light Company, now MidAmerican Energy, which is still a customer today. With World War II came workforce challenges, so 1945 was a welcome year bringing more opportunity for growth. Over time, business expanded into neighboring states, divisions were formed, and the company purchased its first chain saws. Although the chain saws were bulky and heavy, they were a tremendous improvement over the cross-cut.

In 1961, Wright Service Corp. was founded as a parent company to prepare Wright Tree Service for further expansion.

John L. Wright passed away in 1982, and his son John R. Wright took over as president and chief executive officer (CEO). With John R. at the helm, Wright Tree Service swelled its coverage area to 18 states, from Colorado to Indiana and from Minnesota to Texas.

Though the company provided residential tree care from the beginning, that service line came to a halt in the 1980s. In 1993, it was reintroduced as a division with a separate name: Wright Tree Care.

In the fall of 2001, John R. appointed Scott D. Packard to president and chief operating officer (COO) but retained the title of chairman and CEO. In August 2002, John R. approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), effectively transferring ownership of the company to its employees. John R.’s vision was for employees to become financial participants in the success of Wright Tree Service and Wright Service Corp.

In October 2002, John R. passed away at the untimely age of 59. Scott took on the position of chairman and CEO, and in 2008 named Wilbur A. Nutter President and COO.

The rest of that decade brought continued growth for Wright Tree Service and parent company Wright Service Corp. In 2007, Wright Tree Care, the residential division of Wright Tree Service, merged with Heard Gardens, an esteemed landscaping company in Des Moines, to form Wright Outdoor Solutions. Wright Service Corp. invested in the technology, consulting and operations components of the utility vegetation management industry, leading to the 2007 purchase of CNUC and the 2008 creation of Terra Spectrum Technologies, both sister companies to Wright Tree Service.

The trend of growth has continued, with record revenues and the creation of a joint venture with Sustainable Environmental Consultants in 2012. In 2017, Wright Service Corp. officially expanded operations into Canada with their investment in Canadian-based firm Spectrum Resource Group. Wright Tree Service’s geographic footprint grew to 16 divisions with the acquisition of Calgary-based ArborCareTree Service in 2019.

Today, with operations across North America, strong values, continued growth, and an unbeatable service line in cooperation with our sister companies, we think John L. Wright would be proud of the company he started more than 80 years ago as a one-man crew with a few tools in the back of his secondhand car. Employee Owned

Wright Tree Service is a subsidiary of Wright Service Corp., a family of companies, which has been a proud employee owned company since 2002 and a 100 percent employee owned company since 2006. Through shared ownership, Wright Tree Service’s employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) helps promote a positive, unique organizational culture and supports company success. The ESOP is also designed to assist our employees with their retirement and provide them with a financial stake in the company. For our customers and partners, we are empowered to provide exceptional service and innovative solutions. At all levels of the company, you’ll be working with an employee owner – individuals who are invested in the success of the company and the quality of service we deliver.

Wright Tree Service became employee owned because we care about our employees and their communities. The company’s founder, John L. Wright, passed Wright Tree Service on to his son, John R. Wright, in the early 1980s. When a second transition plan became necessary, John R. Wright wanted to share the success of the company with the employees. He had complete confidence in the future of the company in their hands when the decision was made to transition from a family owned company to employee owned. The ESOP enables employees to directly affect profitability and value, and see the results. Owning shares is a unique opportunity for employees to influence the value of their retirement or other savings. They have pride in the company and a vested interest in making sure the value of their account grows. The ESOP has also allowed the company to protect jobs and support the communities we work in.

What other companies operate as ESOPs?
The Wright Service Corp. family of companies is among thousands of other ESOP companies. Check out the most recent announcement of the largest employee owned companies in the U.S. from the National Center of Employee Ownership. You’ll find us on the list!"

“Our growth and recognition in the travel industry confirm that superior service and industry leadership go hand in hand.”
Chrissy Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer – Enterprise Holdings

Enterprise Holdings not only is the world’s largest car rental operator, but also an industry leader in mobility and technology as well as one of the top global travel companies, ranking ahead of many airlines and most cruise lines, hotels, tour operators and online travel agencies. And no matter what transportation challenges our customers face, we have an innovative solution.

Enterprise Holdings – through its independent regional subsidiaries and franchise partners – operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands via nearly 10,000 branches in more than 90 countries and territories. 

This robust global network – operating a fleet of more than 1.85 million vehicles – provides a comprehensive portfolio of transportation solutions, including car rental, carsharing, vanpooling, car sales, truck rental, vehicle-subscription and affiliated fleet management services. As a total mobility provider and an integral part of the automotive value chain, we serve the needs of a wide variety of businesses, consumers, government agencies and organizations day in and day out – and especially when disaster recovery efforts are under way.

A Different Path



Enterprise has been delivering transportation alternatives since 1957. As other car rental companies focused on airports, our founder Jack Taylor took a different path. The concept began in the lower level of a St. Louis car dealership, where Jack and a handful of colleagues worked hard to serve their customers. It was those early customers who shaped our business model. 

They told us they wanted to rent cars where they live and work. And we listened, building an unparalleled neighborhood network of Enterprise Rent-A-Car locations in communities across North America and Western Europe. Then, in 2007, we acquired the National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands, which quickly bolstered our presence at the airport.

Today, our global network offers a total transportation solution – including sustainable mobility options – that extends around the world and well beyond day-to-day car rental. Founding Values

We use computer-generated reports to show our customers precisely what we are doing to help them out. We want them to be able to see line-by-line the type of value that we add to a project.

We use NDT (non-destructive testing). This means that you can know for sure that your project area is safe for people to be in without the worry that we are going to do anything that jeopardizes the integrity of the project itself.

COMPLIANCE FOR CRANES & MORE
The biggest mistakes on a construction site often start out as nothing more than a small error here or there made by someone who didn’t follow a compliance guideline. Sometimes, those who should be implementing compliance guidelines and ensuring that they are adhered to are people who want to skip past them because they are time-consuming. This is unfortunate because those compliance regulations are in place for a reason. When they are ignored, it can create a whole host of problems for the people they impact.

American Inspection and Test, Inc. knows what kind of compliance violations to look out for, and we will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the proper authorities if they are spotted.

Arrowhead Truck Equipment Inc,336211,New York,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Yes,none,https://dejana.com/arrowhead-equipment/,"ABOUT US
In 1957, after serving in the Marine Corps, Pete Dejana borrowed $500 dollars from his father to open a three-bay service station on Park Avenue in Huntington, Long Island.


Shortly thereafter, on a Sunday afternoon, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Al Kurt was driving with his family when his car broke down near the service station, and he came in to Pete for help. Pete brought the car back to the station and made the repairs while the family waited. When finished, Mr. Kurt expressed his deep appreciation and asked to settle the bill. Pete explained that he was a new business owner and asked merely for the opportunity to service his cars in the future.

Mr. Kurt explained that he was responsible for fleet maintenance for (what was then) New York Telephone and it wasn’t long before Pete was performing service and repairs on telephone trucks. Eager to get the business, Pete worked day and night repairing trucks as well as other mechanical equipment that gave the phone company trouble.

As the relationship developed, NY Telephone asked Pete if he would consider going beyond service and repair to actually build the new trucks they needed to their special requirements… Dejana Truck & Utility Equipment was born…


From the first day, Pete Dejana established the business with a very strong commitment to customer service and satisfaction. One of his first customers was a woman named Mrs. Barton who proudly owned a brand new 1956 T-Bird and was adamant about how it was to be maintained. Very few people were allowed to even drive “Baby,” much less work on it, but Pete soon earned the privilege to be her mechanic. For years, Pete meticulously maintained the vehicle and was responsive to her every whim. After 20 years of service, Mrs. Barton needed regular medical care and the relationship faded as they often do.

In 1981 Pete was approached by an attorney representing Mrs. Barton, along with her four sons. It seems that one of her last wishes was that “Baby” be left to Pete.

Pete continues the maintenance on the T-Bird to this day, and it is a symbol of our commitment within the company.

SO IT’S TIME FOR A TRUCK!
Overfilled Truck
This section is intended to provide a basic overview of what we do, some of the terminology that you may come across, and some useful information that you may want to know when looking for a commercial truck.

Dejana is known as a commercial truck “upfitter,” which means we are authorized and certified by a truck manufacturer to modify and design bodies and install them on their chassis. We are also referred to as a final stage manufacturer, a body & equipment company, and a special vehicle manufacturer.

Dejana is also known as a “bailment pool,” which means we are authorized to maintain inventory on behalf of the truck manufacturer to upfit and supply to their dealerships.

We cannot sell a truck directly to you! We do not own the vehicles in our pool, and we can only sell them to the dealership that holds the franchise and it must have some type of upfit.

We can, however, have our sales reps, design engineers and truck equipment specialists help you design a body and match you with a dealership that can.

Truck with Incorrect Weight Distribution over the AxleWhat’s important is your truck is built by an upfitter that is authorized, certified, and insured. It also helps if you understand the fundamentals of things like chassis specifications, GVW & payload. After all, your brand new dump truck may drive great, but is it underpowered for a 3-4 yard body with gravel in it?

Be careful of who solves your problem—you may wind up with a bigger one!

The National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) specifies that 60% of the body should be in front of the rear axle…not behind, yikes!"

OUR STORY
 Our Story Founders
Founders of Moss & Company, Circa 1969

Moss & Company was founded in 1960 by Ron Tamkin, Morton Kirshner, Allen Sackler, and John Liebes in Los Angeles, California. The founders embarked on the journey by syndicating real estate under the fundamental concept that every property is a separate and very real individual business. To achieve success, they knew they had to put people first and to root the company culture in common goals and values. Since then, this concept of ""managing as an owner"" has been the backbone of our organization's growth and success.

In 1990, as the demand for the specialized regional expertise in property management grew, Cindy Gray, now managing partner, introduced third-party property management to Moss & Company. The company continued its growth while earning its reputation as Southern California's leader in property management.

 
Today, Chris Gray serves as president of Moss & Company. Chris manages the company along with the executive team, while guided by the principles and values that are rooted in our humble beginnings.

Power Systems
The successful integration of energy, environmental, and control systems, along with smart devices and data analytics across physical infrastructure offers exciting opportunities in the government and business sectors. Next-generation Smart Integrated Infrastructure (SII) offers the opportunity to better manage the myriad of technologies and resources used to drive and support our information and telecommunications networks.  In the coming decades, management of energy and power resources will be more important than ever before.  While SII offers exciting and capabilities and promise, the basic function of a power distribution system has been the same for over 100 years – the safe, reliable distribution of power from a source to the connected loads. This basic function has not changed, although the complexity of the loads themselves, along with the evolving energy and efficiency requirements, do make its realization more complex.  From operational functionality, to enhanced resilience, and reliability, all the way to energy efficiency and diversity, AllCom has the expertise and the past performance to provide the right power system solutions.

The pace of change continues to accelerate. While it’s increasingly important for federal agencies to stay ahead of the curve, it’s also difficult to even know what that curve may look like. How can federal agencies better prepare for what’s ahead when the future feels so uncertain?

Strategic foresight can help, by providing a framework for challenging assumptions and imagining new scenarios in today's fast-moving world. It has two key benefits:

It can strengthen resiliency, by enabling organizations to visualize, explore and prepare for the unimaginable.
It can foster innovation, helping organizations envision and evaluate new approaches they would not have otherwise considered.
In a new report, learn four steps federal leaders can take to begin adopting and scaling strategic foresight across their agencies.

The world’s leading CCS think tank
The Global CCS Institute is an international think tank whose mission is to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS), a vital technology to tackle climate change and deliver climate neutrality.

With a team of professionals working with and on behalf of our Members, we drive the adoption of CCS as quickly and cost effectively as possible by sharing expertise, building capacity and providing advice and support so that this vital technology can play its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Our diverse international membership includes governments, global corporations, private companies, research bodies and non-governmental organisations; all of whom are committed to CCS as an integral part of a net-zero emissions future.

We are headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, with offices in Washington DC, Brussels, Beijing, London, Tokyo and Abu Dhabi.

 

Accelerating CCS: Five-Year Strategic Plan
Carbon capture and storage has seen a steady rise in both interest and adoption over the last few years. As CCS progress continues to grow, the Institute looks forward to playing a key role in helping to accelerate that journey globally. Read the Institute’s five year plan for more on our strategic framework, mission and vision.


WHAT WE DO
Our mission is to accelerate the deployment of CCS globally
Our activities are focused around three goals:

Build Knowledge
As the world’s leading CCS think tank, we are an unparalleled source of research, data and information on all aspects of CCS deployment. The Global CCS Institute offers expertise and knowledge across every aspect of CCS, providing our Members with accurate, insightful and impactful information and data about CCS, assisting them to build knowledge, connect with the right people and make informed business decisions.

No other organisation has the holistic capabilities or CCS expertise on a global scale. Our team includes geologists, scientists, engineers, economists, policy analysts, climate change experts, business developers and marketers, who provide expertise across the entire CCS spectrum.

Shift the Narrative
We promote and build awareness of CCS and its vital role in achieving energy security and emissions reductions targets to key media outlets, policymakers and important influencers around the world. This is critical given the proliferation of mis-information regarding the reliability, economics and applicability of CCS.

Enable Investment
We work with our Members and other businesses and governments, leveraging our CCS knowledge, skills and expertise, to enable investment in the next wave of CCS facilities. As policy and legislative changes create renewed opportunities around the world, now is the time to drive this investment.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE
Research, data and knowledge
As the world authority on CCS, we are an unparalleled source of research, data and information on all aspects of CCS deployment. Our key knowledge products include:

Our CCS Facilities Database
Thought Leadership
Global Status of CCS Report
Bespoke Consultancy services
Advocacy, engagement and access to influencers
OUR KEY MESSAGES
Guiding the CCS narrative
Our communications and engagement activities are guided by key messages. These messages have been established to reflect our mission and to guide and support the core narrative required for global CCS education, engagement and – ultimately – large scale deployment.

Foster charitable giving within our community and the world at large. Physical Electronics (PHI) was formed in 1969 as a spin-off from the University of Minnesota. The research performed by Roland Weber, Paul Palmberg, and their advisor Bill Peria revealed the extreme surface sensitivity of Auger electron spectroscopy and led to the development of the first commercial Auger surface analysis instruments and the formation of Physical Electronics. As PHI grew, emerging technologies expanded PHI from an “Auger” company to a surface analysis equipment supplier with high performance XPS, D-SIMS, and TOF-SIMS instruments added to our product line.

LEED-Auger appartus
The LEED-Auger apparatus used by Weber, Palmberg, and Peria at the University of Minnesota.
A relationship was established with the ULVAC Corporation in 1971. This relationship led to the formation of ULVAC-PHI in 1982 as a joint venture to market and support PHI’s surface analysis products in Japan. In 2003 ULVAC-PHI purchased Physical Electronics bringing both companies together under one umbrella."

OUR FOUNDER
Rae Construction was founded in 2013 when the owner, Amy Petcovic, decided to uproot from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and move to Phoenix, Arizona. Ms. Petcovic has over 19 years of experience in the construction industry.

She has served as a project manager on numerous projects for the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), USACE (United States Army Corp. of Engineers), and served as a safety liaison and assistant estimator for the DOE (United States Department of Energy), Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and PennDot (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation).

Ms. Petcovic has a Master’s of Science degree, Magna Cum Laude, in Leadership with a specialization in Project Management from Northeastern University.

We started our journey in the construction industry by performing underground work for Cox Communications. Over the last few years we have expanded our market to the federal sector, through utilizing our 8a, HUBZone, WOSB, and EDWOSB certifications. Our certifications have given us the opportunity to work with NAVFAC Southwest, The United States Army Corp of Engineers, The United States Air Force, The Air National Guard, and the Bureau of Land Management to name a few."

Statista is committed to sustainability
Statista has been climate neutral since June 2021. Climate change is one of the most urgent threats of our time. This is our way of contributing to the fight against climate change as a company. Together with ClimatePartner, we are offsetting our unavoidable emissions through reforestation and forest protection in Latin America. How can climate neutrality be achieved?

At Statista, environmental awareness is part of our corporate culture
Our Hamburg office has already been running on 100 percent green electricity and doing most of its accounting digitally since 2016. Beyond that, many of our employees ride their bicycles, use public transportation, or walk to get to work; they are also regularly involved in sustainable initiatives.

Together with ClimatePartner, Statista’s carbon footprint was calculated. Based on this calculation, we offset our unavoidable emissions by contributing to climate protection projects. We are happy to support the following projects in Nicaragua and Brazil.

More information about Statista’s climate neutrality and the climate protection projects supported by us is available under the ClimatePartner tracking ID 15477-2106-1001.

Reforestation in Nicaragua

Through the reforestation of the native bamboo species as well as the protection against deforestation, this project not only makes an important contribution to curbing global warming, but it also creates new opportunities for the locals.

Forest protection in Brazil

With this climate protection project, we support the long-term preservation of the Amazon rainforest. In addition to protecting the rainforest from commercial deforestation, this project also creates alternative sources of income for local families, e.g., through the trade of açaí berries.

Security and data protection
Statista’s account activation process meets the highest security requirements. All of our customers’ payment and contact details are transmitted using SSL encryption. Statista’s technical payment processing is carried out by Stripe Payments Europe Ltd. In addition to the maximum degree of security, we also offer our customers a payment process which is as convenient as possible. All services provided by Statista can be paid for via credit card and also via invoice.

Data protection and transparency are important to us. All stored individual data is anonymized and encrypted. More information about data protection can be found in our Imprint. Feel free to contact support@statista.com or eu.support@statista.com (Europe support) for suggestions and criticism."

OUR PROMISE
We are a principles-based organization that believes in treating our customers, vendors and employees with the utmost integrity and respect. We honor these relationships and will never do anything to compromise them. We’re more than an experienced IT solutions provider; we’re an employee-owned company.

Our goal is to provide our customers with best value solutions and the highest level of customer service possible. Account managers are offered a generous training wage, then graduate to commission. We utilize a “single point-of-contact” philosophy where the account manager is the primary interface with their customers.

Extensive training is available for qualified individuals. Our strongest preference is for individuals who want to work from our Lebanon, N.H., headquarters and live in the Upper Valley area of Western New Hampshire or Eastern Vermont.

This opportunity requires little or no travel and weekday professional hours with a casual dress code.

Lyme Computer Systems is an equal opportunity employer. We are a principle-based organization and we treat our employees, vendors and customers with the utmost integrity and respect.

Lyme Computer Systems will not discriminate with respect to an employee’s or applicant’s age, sex, religion, national origin, race, color, handicap, marital status or sexual orientation.

If you’re looking to join a team where collaboration, innovation and integrity matter just as much as sales expertise, we want to talk to you.

Send your résumé with a cover letter to josh@lyme.com. Lyme encourages employees to contribute to qualifying charitable organizations through its Lyme Matching Gift Program. The program supports employees by offering a way to double their cash contributions (up to a certain limit) to their favorite charitable organization(s) and thus improve their communities. In addition to cash contribution, Lyme believes in giving back to the communities in which our employees live and work by offering volunteer work days."

Founded on a leap of faith, FOG Enterprises LLC provides transportation solutions under a company based on Christian principles. Our company is located in the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwestern Virginia. The leadership of FOG Enterprises includes an experienced truck driver.

Read our mission statement below to find out how we got started and what we stand for as a small, locally owned business.

MISSION STATEMENT
FOG Enterprises building and two owners
Myron, like many other long-haul truck drivers dreamed of a day when he could be his own boss. Crystal working at the same factory for almost 21 years was also ready to be set free from the monotony of the same thing day in and day out. Myron had already bought his own truck and the reality set in that we’ve got everything we need to do this on our own. We had thought about striking out on our own long before we did it, so we already knew what the name was going to be, FOG Enterprises! FOG is an acronym that we heard in church one Sunday and it just stuck! FOG- Favor of God- when we heard it, it struck a chord with us both.

Myron continued to drive as a lease operator, but he also continued to dream about being his own boss. One day, we decided to take a leap of faith and we started FOG Enterprises LLC. We started with two company trucks and favor continues to keep us growing.

We dedicated FOG Enterprises LLC to the Lord on August 22, 2020, with family nearby to witness. We pledge to lead this company for Christ to the best of our ability. Ultimately, FOG Enterprises LLC belongs to the Lord and we are merely His stewards here to oversee His resources.

It is our mission to do everything in our capacity to honor God in all the practices and dealings of FOG Enterprises LLC. We ultimately run under God’s kingdom authority!

ICC was born in a small facility in 2000, starting a venture to load the best lead free and frangible ammunition in the world.  With such high quality ammunition standards, ICC quickly grew to be known as “the world leaders in frangible ammunition.”

We dedicated ourselves to the production of lead free and frangible ammunition because we believe that safety is the most important factor when it comes to shooting.  Our ammo is designed to reduce the risk of shooting related injuries, whether it be from a ricochet or over penetration.

ICC is also proud to be the first company to exclusively manufacture lead free and frangible ammunition. We are deeply aware of the impact that lead ammunition has on the environment and decided to focus on providing the best performing, reliable, shooter-safe, and environmentally safe ammunition available.

What really makes ICC great is the people who work here.  The personnel working here come from Military, Law Enforcement, Corrections, Firearms Instruction, and Loading backgrounds.   There are a great deal of combined skillsets here that understand the importance of quality ammo and have entrusted their lives to it.  With that mindset, each round is loaded and hand inspected knowing that someone will depend on its flawless reliability.

All ammunition is not created equal and sometimes, you simply cannot afford a misfire."

Integrated Energy Models for Transition & Developing Countries

 

 

 

 Armenia: Market Liberalization & Electricity Trade (MLET) Program; Least-cost Energy Development Plan (LCEDP), USAID (2018-2019)

 

DWG experts guided and supported researchers from the Scientific Research Institute of Energy (SRIE) in the tailoring of the TIMES-Starter model into the TIMES-Armenia national energy sector planning model on behalf of the Ministry of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources (MEINR).  DWG has also reviewed and supported SRIE in the development of a Baseline scenario and in the design of specific energy sector development scenarios that underpinned the LCEDP. The analysis highlighted the potential role that renewable electric generation, in particular central solar PV, can play to both meet growing electricity demand and contribute to emission reductions in Armenia. The draft LCEDP: 2020-2036 was reviewed in detail by DWG prior to its publication in November 2019.

World Bank, Thirsty Energy Initiative: Case studies in South Africa and China

 


The World Bank (WB) has embarked on a global initiative called Thirsty Energy to assist countries to tackle water and energy management challenges in an integrated manner, rather than through the traditional decoupled approach. DWG has supported the Bank in the development of this initiative from the concept paper stage, and has coordinated the first two Thirsty Energy case studies in South Africa and China.  The methodology focuses on integrating the various water supply options in a least-cost energy system optimization model. The resulting “water-smart’ energy model ensures that the cost of water is fully captured as energy sector investments are planned.  The finding of these two case studies have demonstrated the process and type of techniques that can be employed to examine the water-energy nexus and the insights that can be gained from integrated energy-water planning.  A number of relevant energy-water policy scenarios in South Africa were explored, and the results show that specific energy sector policies can have significant implication for both new investment in water supply infrastructure and in some cases can lead to stranded water supply investments, and vice versa, reinforcing the importance of planning the water-energy nexus in an integrated manner.

USAID: Regional Energy Security and Market Development (RESMD) - Strategic Planning

 

 

Between 2005 and 2012, the DWG team supported two major USAID projects for the Energy Community Treaty  countries of Southeast Europe and Eurasia to develop a consistent regional approach for assessing energy demand, investment requirements and cooperation opportunities by building national energy system planning models and  capability.  As part of the first project, Southeast Europe Regional Energy Demand Planning Project (SEE-REDP), which was conducted from 2005 to 2007, the DWG team created energy system planning capability by organizing and training teams from eight South East European countries, and worked closely with them to develop MARKAL-based national energy planning models for each country. The data for each model was assembled by the country experts, who were trained by the DWG team to understand and use their models to analyze a range of planning scenarios and priority issues facing the countries.  Specific analyses focused on future energy requirements and the implications of economic growth in the region within the framework of the Energy Community.

  Asian Development Bank: Pakistan Integrated Energy Model

 


The DWG team developed a TIMES energy system planning model that integrates Pakistan’s energy demand and supply situation for all sectors of the country. The DWG team worked with local experts and the Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan to develop needed data, including resource cost-supply curves and useful energy demand projections for Pakistan.  Training and capacity building was provided for a  local energy planning team, comprised of seven institutions,  that enabled them to analyze possible energy futures, assess the impacts of various policy scenarios and support more informed decision-making.

  World Bank: Integrating Energy/Water/Economy Modeling

 


The need to understand the interactions between energy and water use is growing relative to the planning and development challenges surrounding sustainable access to water, land, food, energy and a clean environment – especially as the stresses created by population,  economic development and climate change impacts increase.   The World Bank engaged DWG to assess the current state of knowledge and methods for addressing the energy-water nexus, as well as the economic impacts, and to provide World Bank project leaders with a better understanding of the available methodologies and approaches that can provide quantitative information on energy-water trade-offs.

 

In the second phase of this initiative, DWG is supporting  the Bank as it looks  for candidate countries to actually undertake the linking of appropriate energy, water and economic  models to demonstrate various platforms for examine the nexus.  The intention is to use these a case studies that will be  transferable to other interested countries. One such case study is under development with the University of Cape Town, Energy Research Centre. The Bank is also in discussions with China and Morocco, both of which are enthusiastic about the Thirsty Energy initiative.

  Kuwait: Economic Analysis of Nuclear and Renewable Energy Options

 


The DWG team performed three studies for Kuwait institutions between 2010 and 2012.  The first study, done for the Kuwait National Nuclear Energy Committee (KNNEC), developed a Power and Water Model for the State of Kuwait (KPW), which covered electricity generation and desalinated water production.   This initial KPW model was used to analyze the economic value of Kuwait developing a nuclear power program.  The study found that nuclear power could provide a significant economic savings, in the range of US$20 billion by 2030 and growing to over US$100 billion by 2050.

 

The second study, performed for the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), further developed the KPW model through the addition of new renewable energy (RE) supply technologies and evaluated four scenarios for the energy supply system to meet the forecasted power and water demand.  Two scenarios were based on an energy supply mix consisting of fossil, nuclear, and the most economical RE technologies mix, and two scenarios based on an energy supply mix consisting of fossil and the most economical RE technologies mix. The study found that RE technologies produced their own economic savings and offset some of the projected nuclear capacity.

 

The third study, also performed  for KISR, updated the projections for future crude oil and natural gas prices as well as the projected cost and performance characteristics of the RE technologies of interest to Kuwait, and analyzed the potential for these RE technologies to cost-effectively meet part of Kuwait’s national energy demand.  The study showed that several RE technologies have the potential to make significant contributions to electricity and water production and to produce a net-back savings to the economy, estimated at between US$12 and $40 billion between now and 2035.  The RE technologies that are projected to have a significant cost-effective impact include Solar Trough Hybrids, Wind Power, Solar Towers with Storage, and Solar PV utility-scale.  The study projected the cost-effective share of RE generation that could be in place by 2035 ranges from 24% to 33%.

A STATISTICAL SOLUTION TO A PHYSICS PROBLEM
Document cover imageDocument cover image
The 2014 Larry D. Welch Award winner for best external publication was the IEEE Access article “Mixed Models Analysis of Radar Residuals Data” by IDA researchers Carl Clifford Gaither III, Christopher R. Jackson, Dawn C. Foley Loper, and Jasmina Marsh. In this summary, Loper, the only author still working at IDA, reflects on the team’s incentive in 2012 to address biases in radar observation. Their research focused on residuals that indicate a bias between actual locations of calibration satellites and observations of the satellites’ positions reported by the ballistic missile detection radar known as Cobra Dane. By using a statistical approach instead of the usual physics-based model, the authors were able to control for numerous, random idiosyncrasies of calibration satellites to account for variation in residuals to a greater extent than ever before.

EVALUATING MULTIPATH EFFECTS AFTER 50 YEARS

The 2013 Larry D. Welch Award winner for best external publication was the brief electronic systems communications paper titled “Comparison of Predicted and Measured Multipath Impulse Responses,” by IDA researchers Kent Haspert and Michael T. Tuley. The paper revisited and improved upon the traditional evaluation of multipath effects. Haspert and Tuley’s research found that multipath should be treated as a combination of both specular and diffuse effects. The research presented in the original paper helped create a foundation for future research into the implementation of multipath effects in a classified system.

The 2012 Larry D. Welch Award winner for best external publication was ""The Saddam Tapes: The Inner Workings of a Tyrant's Regime, 1978-2001,"" a book by IDA researcher Kevin M. Woods published in 2011. This summary explores how a close examination of captured state records, namely a significant body of audio files, led to critical insights into Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. As a result, the book serves as educational and enlightening resource for understanding the nature of Hussein's character and of authoritarian regimes more broadly.

Visit our Careers section to learn more about IDA’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. About IDA
The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) is a private, nonprofit corporation headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, DC. IDA’s mission is to answer the most challenging U.S. security and science policy questions with objective analysis leveraging extraordinary scientific, technical, and analytic expertise.



IDA’s FFRDCs
IDA manages three Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs):

IDA Systems and Analyses Center (SAC). The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsors SAC—the first and largest FFRDC IDA manages. Collocated with IDA corporate headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, SAC traces its roots back to 1956, when IDA was formed. The length of the association between IDA and OSD speaks to the mutual trust inherent to the relationship.
IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI). The National Science Foundation sponsors STPI. Located in Washington, DC, STPI primarily supports the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. This FFRDC’s focus is on supporting policymakers with objective analyses on matters of scientific and technological importance to the government.
IDA Center for Communications and Computing. The National Security Agency sponsors the Center for Communications and Computing, which comprises three centers located in Princeton, New Jersey (established in 1959); Bowie, Maryland (established in 1985); and La Jolla, California (established in 1989). This IDA FFRDC focuses on development of innovative technology solutions to complicated mathematical and computational problems in cryptology, which includes both foreign signals intelligence and protecting the communications of the U.S. Government.
Sponsors rely on IDA’s FFRDCs for dispassionate, fact-based, and scientifically rigorous research and advice performed in a research environment free of commercial or shareholder interests where objectivity and the public interest are foremost.

The work produced by IDA’s FFRDCs is characterized by unquestioned objectivity and high quality. Because of our unique relationship with our U.S. Government sponsors, IDA enjoys unusual access to classified government information and sensitive corporate proprietary information. We adhere to a strict regime for avoiding conflicts of interest. We are thus in the position of offering outsider perspectives on important issues with insider access to information.

Guiding Principles
Rigorous Analysis

Our findings and conclusions arise directly from the results of technically exacting and data-driven analyses. By holding ourselves to this high standard, our sponsors can trust the accurate, in-depth, and objective information we deliver to them.

Trusted Expertise

We are devoted to honesty, professionalism, and ethical conduct. We do and say what’s right, even when it isn’t easy. We work closely with our sponsors to make our analyses relevant, responsive, and timely. We report the truth revealed in data and our analyses. We are vigilant in protecting ourselves and our institution from any conflict of interest – real or perceived – that might impugn our research results and preclude these truths from informing public policy discourse.

Inclusion

We embrace differences. We celebrate the inherent value of a team diverse in thought, experience, and demographics.

Collaboration

We maximize the value of different perspectives, backgrounds, and ideas of multi-disciplinary, high-performance teams. Unified by our commitment to a common goal, we surpass what would have been accomplished individually.

Innovation

We are a learning organization – learning from each other, our peers, outside experts, and those we serve to create and improve the capabilities, methods, and approaches used in our work.

Service to the Nation

We exist to inform our Nation’s leaders as they confront the most challenging U.S. security and science policy challenges.

Adam L. Hamilton, P.E., President and CEOAdam L. Hamilton, P.E., President and CEO
Innovation in science and technology has been a hallmark of Southwest Research Institute since its earliest days. It’s no exaggeration to say we are committed to advancing science and applying technology to benefit government, industry, and all of humanity. That is our mission. Our multidisciplinary, collaborative approach allows us to successfully solve clients’ most challenging problems.

Our staff is just as committed today as our founder Thomas Baker Slick Jr. was in 1947 when he proposed that the betterment of humanity depends on the use of advanced science and technology. His dream of building an internationally respected institution working in research and development has, I believe, been more than realized.

Today, we are a leader among independent, nonprofit research and development organizations. Our staff of more than 2,700 scientists, engineers, analysts, and support staff members continues to accomplish outstanding fundamental and applied engineering and research for clients from diverse segments of government and industry. And we will continue to strive to be the first choice for clients seeking solutions for their most complex problems.

WE ARE SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE
At SwRI, we tirelessly pursue innovation and excellence in science and technology for the betterment of humanity We actively support our community
IN THE COMMUNITY
Our staff is expert at developing solutions that help build a better tomorrow today — and that practical, innovative spirit carries through to our community interactions. Staff members generously donate time and other resources to support food drives, blood drives, and other outreach programs.

Yet, as a research and development organization, the next generation of scientists and engineers is key to our continued success. We especially value programs and activities that support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for students. We sponsor internships and scholarships and serve as science fair judges and classroom speakers for area schools, among other activities.

SwRI’s technical accomplishments have been recognized through the years

homas Baker Slick Jr. – an adventurer, philanthropist and oilman – founded SwRI on a South Texas ranch in 1947. After recruiting talent from across the nation, he challenged his team of scientists and engineers to seek revolutionary advancements through advanced science and applied technology. That spirit lives on today. SwRI endures as one of the oldest, independent nonprofit organizations in the United States, providing innovative science, technology, and engineering services to government and commercial clients around the world.

HISTORY OF SwRI
SwRI began as a vision and developed into a reality beyond our founder’s wildest dreams. What started out as a small operation on a converted cattle ranch has grown to more than 2 million square feet of state-of-the-art laboratories, facilities, and offices.

About Esri
What is GIS Advancing the power of geography
For business, government, and society

We make the world's most powerful GIS software
Esri is the global market leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, location intelligence, and mapping. Since 1969, we have supported customers with geographic science and geospatial analytics, what we call The Science of Where. We take a geographic approach to problem-solving, brought to life by modern GIS technology. We are committed to using science and technology to build a sustainable world.



Embracing a geographic approach
To solve our most complex problems, we must first understand them in the crucial context of location. Hidden patterns, trends, and relationships emerge when you visualize and analyze data on a map. This location intelligence provides unique insights that empower real-time understanding and transform decision-making. Beyond sophisticated maps and advanced geospatial analytics, Esri technology enables faster data sharing and more fluid collaboration.


Multi-dimensional ocean views
Visualize many variables at once, such as seawater velocity and temperature, to predict climate change impacts on ocean currents and sea level rise.

Helping solve the world's most complex problems
Business and government leaders around the world apply Esri's technology to understand and address important challenges such as climate change, supply chain resilience, public health, and social equity. Our customers' work is the inspiration for everything we do. 


Biodiversity richness

United Cleanup Oak Ridge Llc,562910,Tennesse,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Yes,Yes,none,https://ucor.com/,"Safely Reducing Environmental Risks
We are cleaning up contaminated, unused facilities on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). In addition to removing excess facilities, we maintain facilities across ORR that are waiting for disposition. We also provide critical upgrades to extend the life of active, but aging, facilities. This continues the same work done by the former UCOR from 2011 to 2022.

UCOR’s workforce is conducting major cleanup activities at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex as well as remedial activities at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP). Under the previous contract, UCOR was DOE’s prime contractor for environmental cleanup at ETTP, where we completed a first-in-the-world cleanup of a gaseous diffusion plant. As a DOE Voluntary Protection Star site—the highest safety designation for a DOE site—we make safety a prerequisite to all that we do.

Cleaning up the Oak Ridge Reservation
Cleanup missions on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) focus on protecting people and the environment from industrial and chemical hazards while enabling current and future science and national security programs. We achieve these goals by working safely, maintaining strong partnerships, and always finishing what we start.

Specific Tasks
Our work scope on the ORR includes demolition, remediation, and operational support.

Demolition
Utility Isolations (also known as Cold and Dark)
Disconnecting the building or structure from all utility sources
(e.g., electricity, water, gas, alarms)
Deactivation
Identifying hazards (e.g., structural deterioration, contamination) and removing hazardous and radioactive materials, equipment, piping, universal waste (e.g., light bulbs, batteries, circuit boards), asbestos, and other items prior to demolition.
Demolition
Destruction and removal of physical facilities and structures, usually accomplished with heavy and/or high-reach equipment
Waste Management & Disposal
Packaging, loading, shipping, and disposing of all waste (e.g., equipment, construction debris, soil) from deactivation, demolition, and remediation activities
Remediation
Identifying the extent of contamination of soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water around the demolition area through sampling (characterization) and removing those contaminants through excavation or treatment (remedial actions)
Operational Support Tasks
Nuclear Operations
Ensuring 24/7 operations of the Liquid & Gaseous Waste Operations (LGWO) facility, which treats contaminated waste from cleanup activities and mission-critical science programs
Surveillance and Maintenance
Providing surveillance and maintenance services for nuclear facilities awaiting demolition, including periodic inspections and maintenance of structures, systems, and equipment to ensure hazards are contained.

The new iteration of UCOR, a partnership of Amentum, Jacobs, and Honeywell, began under a new contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management in May 2022. Under this and our previous contract (2011-2022), UCOR safely deactivates and demolishes former nuclear facilities. As the lead cleanup contractor for DOE’s Oak Ridge Reservation, we have earned a reputation for safe performance, innovative problem solving, and an unwavering focus on excellence. Our workforce of nearly 2,000 is committed to the mission of protecting the people, the community, and the environment while eliminating hazards and reducing risks. Our leadership team brings together individuals with vast experience in the engineering and environmental industries, including experience working in the DOE complex.

UCOR is a partnership of Amentum, Jacobs, and Honeywell that combines the talents of three global program management companies. Our small business partners include RSI EnTech, LLC, Strata-G, LLC, Longenecker & Associates, Inc. (L&A) and Environmental Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) – all firms with previous Oak Ridge Reservation environmental cleanup experience and a proven track record of delivering strong performance.

UCOR’s highly skilled workforce forms a team that is dedicated to the safety and well-being of colleagues and that promotes excellence in performance. Our team includes a wide array of professionals who routinely exercise innovative problem-solving skills and maintain a strong questioning attitude.

Our Values

Our values demonstrate our commitment to maintaining a culture of excellence and serve as a foundation on how we operate every day.

Make safety a prerequisite to all work
Create strong partnerships
Build what we sold; finish what we start
Be investment worthy
Never make a profit or gain at the expense of the client, environment, or workforce
Safety Focused
A strong safety culture is the foundation on which UCOR continues to build an investment-worthy enterprise. Employees and management are dedicated to UCOR’s Zero Injury Philosophy, which is based on the concept that all injuries are preventable. We are recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star site—achieving DOE’s highest level status. This designation is given only to the safest operations in the DOE complex.

Each member actively participates in maintaining a safety culture that is integrated into every aspect of UCOR’s mission on the Oak Ridge Reservation. Learn more about our programs and initiatives, including our Mission Ready© program, that reinforce this commitment to safety."

Understanding how ecosystems work is how we do it.

At Pinyon, we specialize in the biological resources across the Western United States. We study patterns of how migratory birds, raptors, common fauna and flora, riparian, and invasive (i.e., non-native) species co-exist with human beings on the earth.

Then we put this knowledge to work in practical domains:

Information governance is the set of multi-disciplinary structures, policies, procedures, processes and controls implemented to manage information at an enterprise level, supporting an organization's immediate and future regulatory, legal, risk, environmental and operational requirements.



Information governance should determine the balance point between two potentially divergent organizational goals:



Extracting value from information
Reducing the potential risk of information


Information governance reduces organizational risk in the fields of compliance, operational transparency, and reducing expenditures associated with e-discovery and litigation response. An organization can establish a consistent and logical framework for employees to handle data through their information governance policies and procedures.

eDiscovery

Electronic discovery or eDiscovery refers to detection in legal proceedings such as litigation, government investigations, or Freedom of Information Act requests, where the information sought is in electronic format (often referred to as electronically stored information or ESI). EDiscovery is subject to rules of civil procedure and agreed-upon processes, often involving review for privilege and relevance before data are turned over to the requesting party.



The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is a universal diagram that represents a conceptual view of these stages involved in the e-discovery process.

Gormley Environmental Corporation,562910,Maryland,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,https://www.gormleyenvironmental.com/,"Gormley Environmental Corporation or (GEC) is a full-service environmental contractor founded over 20 years ago. Gormley Environmental Corporation started as Professional Asbestos Removal Corporation by Larry Gormley, Sr.  Throughout the years, this family-owned Washington, DC metropolitan service company continued to grow.  Larry Gormley, Sr. passed this company down over twenty years ago to his son, Larry Gormley, Jr. 


GEC has continued to grow throughout the years and is now a full service environmental contractor.  With well over 50 years of combined experience in Asbestos, Lead and other environmental remediation services.  GEC can handle most abatement needs in commercial and government buildings.  We specialize in catering to our clients to develop procedures for abatement around their work schedules and environments.  This has enabled us to satisfy the needs of many government agencies, corporations, and financial institutions in the Washington Metropolitan Area. 

 

GEC has invested into educating, training, and licensing our employees.  At minimum our employees have been trained to meet the license requirements in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.  Supervisors have also had extra training to meet the licensing requirements in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Asbestos AHERA program.  Although mold currently is not regulated, we have trained our employees as per recommendations by the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Associations (OSHA).

 

We firmly believe in expanding the knowledge of our employees in the field.  This enables us to have a rapid emergency response time and work with our clients to exceed the training expectations.  As a result, many of our employees have first-aid, CPR training, confined space training, and hazardous communication awareness training.  Furthermore, we have roundtable safety tool box meetings with our employees to ensure compliance and safety awareness issues are resolved. 

 

Being a full service contractor, we can effectively conduct safety audits of work spaces and provide our clients with good, sound recommendations.  Should environmental sampling be needed our staff and sub-contractors are well trained in collecting samples, writing summaries of findings, and interpreting analytical data.  This helps enable fast turnaround times and reliable data. 

 

Our Quality Control Procedures here at GEC are quite strict.  We ensure that all equipment, whether arriving at home base or leaving to a job site, is cleaned, maintained, and in good working condition.  Our project managers handle these tasks, which allows our supervisors to perform their jobs and meet or exceed our client’s needs and expectations.  

ASBESTOS ABATEMENT
Asbestos is a naturally occurring silicate mineral that was heavily used in the manufacturing industry in the late 19th century.  It's high tensile strength, fire and heat resistance, and sound absorbtion were a few of the physical properties that made it a perfect building material.  Over the years it has been proven that asbestos can cause several dibilitating diseases such as: asbestosis, mesothelioma, lung cancer, and others.  Properly abating asbestos in the living and working areas is a major priority and needs to be done carefully; following all regulations.  GEC has a proven history of adequatly identifying and abating asbestos containing materials (ACM) quickly and effectively.


Services
 

Following all applicable codes and regulations and with the use of all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and approved tools; licensed and trained GEC employees perform the following asbestos abatement tasks:

 

Build total enclosure regulated containments

Fine cleaning any contaminated areas

Use glovebags to perform abatement for projects under NESHAP limitations

Repair disturbed asbestos with the use of a bridging encapsulant

LEAD ABATEMENT
Lead is a heavy metal element that has been used over the years in multiple aspects of building construction.  Lead can cause a variety of heath concerns if ingested, including attacking the brain and nervous system and several blood disorders.  Lead-based paint (LBP), one of the more common forms of lead, is found on all types of interior and exterior building surfaces. With age, this paint begins to weaken and flake making it a distinct threat, and one that needs to be handled with professionalism and care.  GEC has accrued countless examples of projects where LBP has been identified, removed, and disposed of efficiently. 


Services
 

Following all applicable codes and regulations and with the use of all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and approved tools; licensed and trained GEC employees perform the following lead abatement tasks:

 

Wet lead scrapes

Chemically strip components of LBP

Fine clean any areas (interior or exterior) contaminated with lead dust

Encapsulate disturbed lead paint with an adhesive paint

Work with a subcontractor to provide air monitoring to accurately monitor and clear work areas

Dispose of all lead waste at approved landfills

MOLD REMEDIATION
Mold is a naturally occuring fungus that develops as a result of three limiting factors: moisture, temperature, and a source of growth.  Mold has always been present in households and offices, indoors and out.  But, today it has been identified that mold spores can worsen allergies, increase respiratory problems, and cause headaches by means of inhalation or ingestion.  Although the extent of health effects is medically unproven it has been a hot topic over the last decade.  Removing hazardous mold from households and work environments is something that needs to be taken care of immediately. Unlike the other hazardous elements that GEC handles, mold spreads and grows over time making it actively dangerous.  With similar procedures as other types of abatement, mold remediation is another environmental hazard that GEC specializes in removing.​


Services
 

Following all applicable codes and regulations and with the use of all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and approved tools; trained GEC employees perform the following mold remediation tasks:

 

Use full containment procedures to control and contain mold spores under negative pressure

Demolish and dispose of mold impacted building surfaces 

Take and record moisture readings to identify moisture impacted areas using a Protimeter

Provide air-circulation and dehumidifying services

? The use of a professional interpreter greatly reduces risk. A study published in
the Annals of Emergency Medicine found that nonprofessional interpreters
(such as family or friends) had a 22% percent error rate compared to
professionals, who had a 2% percent error rate. Of the 1,900 errors noted in
the study, 18% percent of those studied could have had serious
consequences to a patients health.
? Legal instructions can be very confusing and language barriers make it
even more difficult. Studies show that 28% of the United States population
cannot follow directions due to language barriers. When given instructions
or relaying on their understanding of how to properly interpret for
themselves or their families, this segment of our population tends to have a
very low understanding and negative outcomes.
? More than 25 million Americans speak English less than very well,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and more than 60 million speak a
language other than English at home. This population is the least likely to
receive preventivecare or legal resources,
& the population has less access
to regular healthcare. The Limited English Proficiency population is much
more likely to have adverse effects of drug complications, poor
understanding of law, lack of care for diagnoses, low literacy, and
a greater
risk of being misunderstood.

CASE STUDY

PSG was asked to design and fabricate a very large incline conveyor to move a dairy product from the processing area up to the packaging platform.  The customer specified a one-piece fully seal welded Intralox Thermodrive Urethane belt.  This belt is closed and very difficult to clean. Food Safety QC required removing the belt on a regular schedule to soak and clean the belt and conveyor frame.  It was also essential for the belt to be removed without the need for skilled workers using specialized tools or equipment.  PSG was happy to take on the challenge. "

A Use Case for Trust Markers in ORCID Records: Streamlining the Credentialing Process 
About ORCID

ORCID, which stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a global, not-for-profit organization sustained by fees from our member organizations. We are community-built and governed by a Board of Directors representative of our membership with wide stakeholder representation. ORCID is supported by a dedicated and knowledgeable professional staff.

Our Vision
ORCIDs vision is a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time.

Our Mission
In order to realize our vision, ORCID strives to enable transparent and trustworthy connections between researchers, their contributions, and their affiliations by providing a unique, persistent identifier for individuals to use as they engage in research, scholarship, and innovation activities.

We do this by providing three interrelated services:

        The ORCID iD: a unique, persistent identifier free of charge to researchers
graphic of cloud database of ORCID records        An ORCID record connected to the ORCID iD, and 
graphic of ORCID api        A set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as well as the services and support of communities of practice that enable interoperability between an ORCID record and member organizations so researchers can choose to allow connection of their iD with their affiliations and contributions
Our Plans
The core of our strategic focus for 20222025 is to build commitment to and engagement with ORCID as an essential element of the research experience, both for researchers and members. We invite you to review From Vision to Value: ORCIDs 20222025 Strategic Plan. We hope it inspires our member organizations to engage with us as they plan their own work and activities.

Our Values
ORCID is an integral part of the wider digital infrastructure needed for researchers to share information on a global scale. We position the researcher at the center of everything we do.

Open
Our work is open, transparent, and non-proprietary. We make decisions collaboratively, involving our staff, Board, those who support our mission, and the researchers and community that are the purpose of our work.

Trusted
We strive to be a trusted component of research infrastructure with the goal of providing clarity in the breadth of research contributions and the people who make them. We are guided by the principles of privacy and researcher control and the vision of identifier-enabled research information infrastructure.

Inclusive
We take an inclusive view. We have a diverse team, deployed internationally in our virtual office. We engage with a wide range of organizations and people to ensure broad viewpoints.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at ORCID

Read more about ORCIDs DEI philosophy, our principles, our DEI activities in our community, and how we embed DEI practices into all aspects of operations.

Our Founding Principles
ORCID will work to support the creation of a permanent, clear, and unambiguous record of research and scholarly communication by enabling reliable attribution of authors and contributors.
ORCID will transcend discipline, geographic, national, and institutional boundaries.
Participation in ORCID is open to any organization that has an interest in research and scholarly communications.
Access to ORCID services will be based on transparent and non-discriminatory terms posted on the ORCID website.

ORCID will be governed by representatives from a broad cross-section of stakeholders, the majority of whom are not-for-profit, and will strive for maximal transparency by publicly posting summaries of all Board meetings and annual financial reports.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at ORCID
We are all unique; connected we are better
From the beginning, ORCIDs vision was an inclusive one: a world where all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation activities are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time.

By virtue of the fact that we provide a name-independent person identifier for researchers, ORCID inherently encourages inclusivity and equitable treatment of those whose names are more likely to change over their careers, for example, transgendered people, and women in cultures where it is traditional for them to change names upon marriage.

ORCIDs DEI Statement, We are all unique; connected we are better, combines both aspects of our primary mission to both disambiguate researchers from one another by means of a unique identifier and to keep researchers connected to their research outputs throughout their careers.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion at ORCID
We are all unique; connected we are better.
ORCIDs DEI Principles
In summer of 2020, we issued a statement of solidarity for Black Lives Matter in the wake of the horrific events that rightfully inspired so many in scholarly communications to pause and reflect on our part of upholding and furthering equity and justice. As we mentioned in that post, we established a working group to ensure we are living up to our vision, and to the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion, in every way we can. It was composed of interested ORCID staff and met monthly to raise issues, discuss solutions, develop initiatives and ensure continual alignment to ORCIDs values and mission as a community-driven organization.

Empathy
Empathy is an enormous concept and includes not only the ability to understand the world from anothers point of view, but the curiosity to learn and the willingness to validate that point of view, even if (especially if) it differs from our own.

Equity
Equity includes concepts of fairness and justice. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines equity as the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically. Do the services ORCID offers take into account the differing environmental abilities and constraints of our community?

Transparency
Are we being as clear and transparent as we can be about our motives and processes? Are we inviting feedback and criticism? Are we able to employ our empathy to consider what is being reflected back to us from our members and users?

Appreciation
Even if appreciation is not a common DEI principle, we at ORCID feel it is important principle to include. Appreciation is the willingness to look for and the ability to recognize and enjoy the positive qualities of other people or groups of people. How generous are we with our expression of appreciation for our staff, and of our community?

Inclusion
Diversity advocate Vern? Myers once said, diversity is being invited to the party, but inclusion is being asked to dance. Are we fostering a diverse field of inclusion and participation? Are we encouraging people to participate with us, and lowering the barriers to make that possible? 

Humility
Humility is founded in the belief that we are not, and no one is ever, perfect  there is always room for improvement. Are we living up to our values as completely as we can? Does what we do contribute to a better world? Are we taking responsibility for where we are right now and forging a path to improvement wherever that is needed? Where can we go next?

DEI is an ORCID-wide initiative
In order to hold ourselves accountable, our original DEI group remains intact but has been expanded to include everyone throughout ORCID. We realized that if we want ORCID to excel at DEI, it should not be considered a separate bolt-on activity. Like privacy, it should be embedded into everything we do, and we should examine every activity and project with a DEI lens to ensure that it adheres to our values and founding principles. And though the ORCID Board and Executive Director are ultimately responsible to ensure we are living up to our values, we are all responsible for creating an environment conducive to a strong DEI culture.

After our DEI group accomplished the task of establishing our DEI principles, we transferred ownership of our DEI Initiatives and priorities to our senior leadership team, who in turn manages them through our existing operational processes. The DEI group shifted from being a working group to being a forum to assess how the Senior team is applying DEI to all of its initiatives, projects, and activities. At their November 2021 meeting, our Board reviewed our DEI principles and resolved to commit to the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion in all that we do to create a more inclusive community for all.

ORCID DEI in the community
As we strengthen our internal DEI practices to embed them into all aspects of operations, we are keeping an eye on external initiatives where our focus and capabilities could be particularly helpful. We have engaged in discussions with a number of members of the transgendered researcher community, NISO and COPE (the Committee on Publication Ethics), and have established a new partnership with The Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications (C4DISC), an organization that was formed to discuss and address issues of diversity and inclusion within our industry and create shared best practice resources and toolkits. We have adopted their Joint Statement of Principles and encourage you to explore their excellent repository of resources, including their Toolkits for Equity: Transforming Scholarly Publishing Communities."

(Proud to be part of the Cherokee Hills Cultural Byway.)
The Lower Illinois River with its trout fishery, along with numerous recreational areas such as Tenkiller and Greenleaf Lakes and the R. S. Kerr Reservoir have helped make Gore proud to be known not only as The Trout Capital of Oklahoma but also the Gateway to the Lakes and a Sportsmans Paradise.
Gore offers YEAR ROUND TROUT FISHING, with the Oklahoma Wildlife Department stocking 100,000 rainbow trout annually at three sites, the River Road Access Area, MarVal Resort and Tenkiller Powerhouse.  These sites are stocked weekly in March, April, and May; biweekly the rest of the year.
Sustained springtime water releases bring white bass on their spawning run all the way to the Webbers Falls Lock and Dam and the dams at Tenkiller and Greenleaf Lakes.  These releases also attract walleye, striped bass and even paddlefish.  During the hot summer months you can find stripers, walleye and sauger on the lower end of the Illinois River.

Whatever your interest is you will find it in Gore.  Whether you just want to relax at the lake, go shopping in one of our many antique stores or try out the scuba diving on Lake Tenkiller, you are sure to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere of Gore.  Located on the Lower Illinois River and just 7 miles from Lake Tenkiller, there are so many different things to do, you will need to come back several times to try them all. History of Gore
By Paul Eichling

The settlement which became known as Gore reaches far back into the history of the area. Gore appeared on the earliest French maps of Louisiana Territory prepared by a French explorer, Guillaume de Lille in 1718 as Mentos or Les Mentous. Before the Cherokee Indians came to the area, two partners operated a salt works on Saline Creek, seven miles northeast of the present town, and at times more than a hundred huge kettles were used for boiling salt water. The salt was shipped down river to New Orleans. When the Cherokees came into the Territory, Walter Webbers, a prominent Cherokee, was given this district as his allotment and he took over the salt works.

Walter Webber built his trading post just below the falls on the Arkansas River. In 1806 the falls were reported to be six feet in height and during low water the falls were impassible except for smaller boats which could be carried around the barrier. Sometime after Walter Webber died, William L. Holt, an Englishman, established his home on the eastern bank of the Arkansas River near the falls. Here he farmed and established a trading post which was called Holts Landing. William Holt and his wife, a Cherokee named Nellie Miller, raised a family of nine. His descendants still live on the land that he settled and the town of Gore was laid out on some of that land.

On the banks of the Arkansas River south of the present site of Gore is the Illinois Camp Grounds. Here was the site of the capital for the old Settlers or the Cherokees which became known as the Cherokees west. John Holly, a Cherokee Chief, built his home on Deep Branch near the capital. He helped establish a school at the place which was known as Council Hill. A council house, called Tahlonteeskee, was built also. Tribal courts were held at this site until 1839 when the Cherokees West were united with the Cherokees that had been forced out of the Eastern part of the United States. It was at Tahlonteeskee, October 31, 1831 that Sam Houston was adopted into the tribe. That adoption read: Resolved by the National committee and Council in General Council Convened, That in consideration of his former acquaintance with, and services rendered to the Cherokees and his present disposition to improve their condition and benefit their circumstances, and our confidence in his integrity and honor, if he should remain among us, we do solemnly, firmly, and irrevocably grant to Samuel Houston forever, all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Signed, Walter Webber, President, William Thornton, Clerk, Aaron Price, Speaker of Council, John Brown, Clerk of Council and approved by John Jolly. Houston lived among the Indians, took a wife, and remained for some time.

William Holts store at Holts Landing was operated until the Civil War. Shipments were made to the landing by boats from Forth Smith that regularly traveled the river during high water. Most of the goods were hauled by the Mary D, piloted by Captain Blackely. Another boat was the Jennie Mae. When the boats returned to Fort Smith, they would haul cotton corn, and seeds. Mr. Holt was killed on the sandbar opposite his home in the battle of Webbers Falls on April 25, 1863 when the forces of Colonel William A. Philips from Fort Gibson attacked the forces at Webbers falls.

Following the Civil War which divided families even in the Indian Territory, many people displaced from the South began moving into the Territory and small settlements began to grow. So would the settlements of Webbers Falls and Gore grow.



In 1884 a Sunday school was organized in the settlement near the eastern side of the Arkansas River. It was organized and called the Illinois Town Sunday School. The settlement had become known as Illinois, probably because it was in the district of the Cherokee Nation known as the Illinois District. The Methodist Episcopal Church South had sent missionaries into the Indian Territory early and here in the settlement a small church was built and it was also used as a school.



The settlement of Illinois Town was further established by the railroad. In November of 1885 the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway was incorporated under the general laws of Arkansas. Work was begun on a stretch of railroad beginning at the Arkansas-Oklahoma State Line west of Van Buren, Arkansas to Wagoner, Oklahoma. This stretch was finished in 1888. The stretch from Wagoner to the Oklahoma-Kansas state line was finished in 1889, connecting Wagoner to Coffeyville, Kansas.

In 1890 this railroad was leased to the Saint Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway Company and was sold to, what was called by the locals as, the Iron Mountain Railroad, in 1909. All along this railroad route, small settlements began to form and it wasnt long until the settlement that has become the town of Gore began growing. At first the trains would stop closer to the Illinois River where they could get good clean water. A tower was built and for some time the train would stop there. It was called Illinois Station. People could board the train there or at the stop in the settlement. After a while the train only stopped in the settlement.

Dr. William Wallace Campbell, William Holts grandson, established his home on the eastern banks of the Arkansas River just below the falls. His medical office was at Webbers Falls, but he served the area for miles around. Campbell was born in the Saline District of the Cherokee Nation in 1836. His father was John Campbell and his mother was Eliza Holt, the daughter of William and Eliza Miller Holt. Both Campbells parents were from Tennessee. Dr. Campbell had attended the Cherokee Male Seminary and graduated from the University of Nashville, Tennessee in 1861. He served during the Civil War as a Confederate Surgeon.

In the early days the only way to cross the river was to ford it, and when the river was too high to ford, travelers would have to use the ferry that was owned and operated by Dr. Campbell. Two ferries, a steam operated one and a cable one, were operated by Dr. Campbell and Judge Lynch of Webbers Falls. Judge Lynch ran the Webbers Falls side of the ferry while Campbell owned the eastern side rights. After Judge Lynchs death, his wife and Dr. Campbell sold their interest in the ferry business to David S. and Charlie Summers, who operated the ferries until the bridge was built in 1923.

In 1888 a depot was built and on August 10, 1888, the post office was established at the Campbell Store in Illinois Station. David M. Barrick was the first postmaster. Letters came both addressed to Illinois Station and Campbell, Indian Territory and many came with both addresses on them. Also, in 1888,  Andrew James Boyd and his family, moved to Illinois Station from Arkansas. Andrew was a Methodist Missionary and he had brought with him two carloads of lumber with which to build a Methodist Church. The church was built and Mr. Boyd became the first minister. He was appointed by the Indian Missionary Conference to serve the Webbers Falls and Gore Circuit.  Mr. Boyd later moved to Webbers Falls.

From the Fort Smith Weekly Elevator, Friday, June 21, 1889: ILLINOIS STATION: This is virtually a branch of Webbers Falls on the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railroad, on the opposite side of the Arkansas River, and is about one-and-a-half miles from the falls. Mr. J.W. Hayes keeps a management of J.E. Hays, formerly of this place (Webbers Falls). Lynch and Campbell also have a general merchandise establishment and R. Campbell has another establishment where he keeps drugs as well as other merchandise. Here also is the Mays Hotel, a branch of the Southern Hotel at the Falls, owned by Mr. McDaniel and presided over by two of his daughters. Reverend Mr. Boyd has erected a church here also, in which a good school is conducted

From the Weekly Phoenix, Muskogee, March 9, 1893: On the Illinois side: Dr. W.W. Campbell, for whom the Post Office was named lives in a fine residence just south of the railroad. Further east is the business house of Thomas Carlisle. Judge Wallace Ratleys live adjacent. On the north side of the track is the fine large mercantile house and gin of the Hayes estate, with J.E. Hayes as managerBack of this are snug cottages of J.E. Hayes, Mr. Boulineau, and Mr. A.K. Berry, notary, with his sister. Miss Pearl. A good hotel is kept by Mrs. Carrie Hildebrand; while east of the depot, Mr. Ben Hayes and family reside. This composes about all of the immediate town.

Mrs. Nannie E. Campbell Winn, the daughter of Dr. Campbell told the following story of the per capital payment to the Cherokee Indians in the summer of 1894 published in the Muskogee Phoenix, April 11, 1976 and written by Marguerite McFadden, a granddaughter of Reverend Andrew Boyd. On July 20, a crowd numbering thousands flocked to Webbers falls, and on Saturday and Sunday the town and surrounding forest and prairie were alive with visitors, waiting for the distribution of funds, which commenced at 9 oclock on Monday morning, July 22, 1894. The payment continued for four days. The crowds were coming into the area from all directions and by all manner of conveyances. Wagons drawn by mules and horses, horseback riders, buggies, and people on foot came in by the thousands. Mrs. Winn stated that many of the people came by train and the traffic was so heavy on the ferry that it was loaded to capacity time and time again. She stated that her father had taken in $500.00 per day for the duration of the payment.

The better farmland was on the Webbers Falls side of the river. Potatoes were a choice crop during this period of time and the train was the best way of getting goods to market. This provided another good season for the ferry.

By 1897 when the original survey was made, there were approximately twenty dwellings in the town. There were by this time, three stores, a cotton gin, two hotels and a Methodist Church.

In 1898, Dr. John A. Eichling established his medical practice in Campbell, Indian Territory. He had graduated from Barnes Medical College in St. Louis. He was born in Indiana and had taught school there. In 1899 he was the owner of the Illinois Drug Company from which he practiced and provided medicines. Also that year he went back to Indiana and brought his new bride to Campbell.

Campbell is listed in Polks Indian Territory Gazetteer and Business Directory for 1902-1903. The following was included: Population 250. On the Arkansas River and on the St Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railway, in the Cherokee Nation 47 miles northwest of Fort Smith, Arkansas, twenty and three/fourths miles from Sallisaw and twenty-one and one/fourth from Fort Gibson, both of which latter places afford banking facilities. Has Christian and Methodist churches. Telephone connection. Esp., Pacific. Tel., W.U. Wm Halloway, Postmaster; John Brown, barber; R.B. Carlile, general store; F.L. Clark, livestock: Mrs. J.A.

On Wednesday, January 29, 1902 in the Records of the United States Court, Indian Territory, Northern District, at Muskogee, forty-two qualified voters of the Indian Territory sought for the settlement of Campbell, Indian Territory to be incorporated. The postmaster William Halloway was the only individual for the town of Gore. In the weekly newspaper of Webbers Falls known as The Monitor, on Friday, May 24, 1902 this was attested. In the Campbell chat column it was reported that The petition for incorporation was signed by 45 men  All there are in town.

During this period of time the mercantile establishments faced the railroad. On the eastern side of the railroad on North Railroad Street was located the stockyard. Ranches from all over the area brought their cattle here to load on the trains. The small town of Campbell which was laid out in 1903 was bustling with new life. The Campbell Register, the first newspaper to be published in the town of Campbell was edited by Fred Bertram Eichling, the brother of Dr. John A. Eichling. Fred Eichling received his law degree in Indianapolis, Indiana and moved to Porum in 1904 and from there to Campbell. The first edition was September 14, 1906. It was a paper consisting of four pages. Seth K. Cordon later published a weekly newspaper in Campbell which was called The Citizen. It was still in publication at the time of Mr. Cordons untimely death in 1912.

In 1908, Fred Eichling established his law office in the town of Gore and handled real estate. His advertisement read: GREETING: We take pleasure in presenting to the public the liveliest town on the map located in the rich Arkansas and Illinois River country on the trunk line of the Iron Mountain Road, Kansas and Arkansas Valley Division. History credits the Cherokee tribe of Indians with appropriately naming the different Sections of their beautiful country according to its location and condition. This same tribe of Indians christened the beautiful valley of some 100,000 acres of the finest agricultural land in the Indian Territory, Illinois, and the thriving little town of Campbell is located in the very heart of this valley just one half mile north of the Arkansas River and two miles west of the Illinois, with the majestic range of mountains containing rich mineral and timber, towering to the northward; nature has been particularly kind to this locality. Splendid drinking water is found at a depth ranging from twenty-five to sixty feet. One mountain stream, the Illinois, fed by perpetual springs, winds its way the year around to the Arkansas River; this with the Arkansas River furnishes an unlimited supply of water for factories; the rich land adjacent to the little city of Campbell is wholly dependent upon Campbell for supplies.

The timber is another item that is another important feature of the valley and the shipment of walnut logs is bringing in a large amount of money. A saw mill near the town is furnishing all the rough lumber used in building, and at a much cheaper rate than it can be purchased in other markets.

As to the railroad facilities, Campbell is very fortunate as it is situated on the trunk line of the Iron Mountain Road between Little Rock, Arkansas and Coffeyville, Kansas.

Campbell now has one bank, just incorporated September I, 1906, three general stores, one drug store, billiard and pool hall, two good hotels, two cotton gins, two blacksmith shops, one barbershop, a meat market, two restaurants, livery stable, millinery store and two physicians, saw mill and good stone quarry near town; a $10,000 brick building is now under construction to be occupied by the bank and three general stores and several brick and stone buildings will be built in the near future.

Investors from New York City are here now looking to put a bridge across the Arkansas River costing nearly $150,000; We shipped from here last year cotton, potatoes, corn, and tons of hay. Nine-tenths of our agricultural land is yet undeveloped and our mineral land is as nature put it; still can be seen the turkey, deer, wolf, and wildcat, but they are rapidly disappearing by the hand of civilization and the next few years will find them almost driven out of the country; fruit grows in abundance where it has been tried, one man taking the prize on peaches at the Worlds Fair at St. Louis, thirty-six of his peaches making a bushel. The swift Illinois River furnishes an unlimited supply of waterpower.

The rush is on! Wide awake men are flocking to the Indian Territory by the thousands! Lands that for thirty or forty years have been used only for grazing purposes are being converted into farms and the yield of wheat, oats, millet, maize, Indian corn, melons, cotton, potatoes, and vegetables is amazing. Veritable fortunes have been amassed in a few years by those who settled here, and no one is more surprised at the result than themselves.

Eichling Realty & Insurance Company has farms to sell, lease, or rent. Every tract of land handled by us is carefully examined and the result is every customer is our friend.

In 1907, Oklahoma became a state and the town became Campbell, Oklahoma. Campbell was growing and the citizens felt the need to call a bond to build a new schoolhouse. Dr. J.W. Sosbee, Riley Cleveland, and Dr. John A. Eichling were members of the school board, and both Dr. Sosbee and Dr. Eichling gave land upon which the school would be built. The cornerstone was laid in 1908 and the building was ready for the 1909 school year. It was a modern two-story brick building heated by coal stoves. The day the school opened the children marched from the old schoolhouse, which was also the Methodist Church, to the new school. Dr. John A. Eichling gave a lot also to the Methodist Church in April of 1909 and a new church building was soon constructed.

In the early hours of April 4, 1909, a fire was discovered in the business section of the town and nearly every building of importance was burned. The story was carried in the Webbers Falls Record on April 9, 1909. It read: The business section of our sister city, Campbell, was practically wiped out by fire early Sunday morning. The building occupied by the pool hall was discovered to be on fire about 4 a.m. and it quickly spread to adjoining buildings despite the heroic efforts of Campbells citizens to check it. Besides the pool hall, Dr. Sosbees Office, Jon Sours candy kitchen, Lyons restaurant, the brick block occupied by the bank, Wynns pharmacy, Ingrams general store, Gilliland-Hayes Merc. Co, the post office, a feed store and the Dyke Bros. lumber yard, the Gilliland-Hayes cotton gin and four cottages were burned. The bank officials were able to save all their books, securities, cash and practically all the furniture, and they were opening business Monday morning in another building. The contents of the post office were also moved as well as some of the contents of the other buildings. The brick block will be rebuilt immediately and occupied by the same firms that burned out. We understand that Gilliland-Hayes have purchased the Grant Rasor store and are now conducting business at that stand. Mr. Wynn has purchased the Dr. Eichling drug store where he will continue business until the new brick block is completed.

In the Oklahoma Gazetteer for 1909 Campbell boasted: Population, 350. An incorporated town on the Arkansas River and on the St. L, I.M. & S. Ry., in Sequoyah County, 47 miles northwest of Fort Smith, Ark., 22 from Sallisaw, the county seat, and 1 1/2 from Webbers Falls, the nearest banking point. Tel., W.U. Exp., Pacific.

On October 22,1909 the name of the town was officially changed to Gore in honor of Senator Thomas P. Gore. There are several stories as to how the town got its name, but at statehood there just happened to be another Campbell, Oklahoma so Campbell, Sequoyah County, Oklahoma needed a new name. One story told is that the local baseball team needed suits and one of our towns leaders contacted Senator Gore and asked for a donation to secure the suits and if he chose to help, the name of the town would be changed in his honor. Whatever the reason the town has been called Gore since that time. Thomas Pryor Gore was born in Mississippi in 1870. He was the first blind Senator to enter the United States Senate. In 1901 he moved to Lawton, Oklahoma Territory. He became one of the most eloquent and able thinkers in the two territories on matters of government. Senator Gore died in 1949.

The Farmers Bank of Illinois was the first bank to locate in the present town of Gore. The Nakdimen family of Fort Smith, Arkansas, owned the bank. During the financial crisis of the early 1920s the bank failed and it wasnt until many years later that the branch banks of Lake Country and Vian State Bank provided once again banking for the town.

In the early days many people would gather and watch the independent baseball teams play. The first field was what would now be in front of Steve Sloans home. Waldo Eichling told the story that as a boy, he would carry water from his home cistern on main street to the field and sell it for 5 cents a dipper. About 1930 this area was sold and the new owner wanted it fenced for grazing his cattle. The players had to find a better place. Several of them put their heads together and decided to clean up the area that today is the present baseball park. The homes that had formerly been on the area and had been destroyed in the disastrous fire of 1909 still had foundations that had to be removed, Cisterns were scattered all over the seven-lot area. But determined to have a field to
play upon, the team went to work and filled the cisterns. Waldo Eichling, second baseman, remembers that an old safe that had been destroyed in the fire was placed in the cistern nearest the old second base. Many loads of sand were hauled from the river. This was in the early thirties and the field has been used ever since. In the 1950s the three of the four lots along Main Street were given to the school by the Nakdimen family. The field was turned around after the Johnston Family gave some lots to provide a greater playing area.

The Thirties hit Gore just as they hit the other areas of our country. Depression time came. The Dust Bowl Days were a reality for the Gore area. Many of our citizens joined the movement west and many today are living in California. Many came back!

In 1936 a tornado damaged most of the homes and businesses in Gore. It struck with fury and before anyone knew it much damage was done. But determined people started rebuilding. Dr. Eichlings office had been one of the victims and a new office building was started. He built the first sidewalk in town from this new office to his home. Later the town fathers extended the sidewalk from his office to the business buildings on Main Street.

2018 Trustees
Composition of the Board
Princeton University is governed by a Board of Trustees that consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members. The President of the University and the Governor of the State of New Jersey serve ex officio with vote.

There are three categories of trustee: Charter Trustees and Term Trustees are elected by the Board for terms of eight and four years respectively; Alumni Trustees are elected by the alumni members of the University and serve four-year terms. There are 13 Alumni Trustees. Each year the current junior and senior classes, and the two most recently graduated classes, elect a member of the senior class as an Alumni Trustee.

There are always at least two alumni of the Graduate School on the board. In addition to the 13 Alumni Trustees, the bylaws call for no fewer than four and no more than ten Term Trustees, and the remainder of the Board are Charter Trustees. Trustees do not have to be alumni of the University.

 

Powers and Responsibilities of the Board
The powers and allocations of responsibilities of the Board derive from, and are set forth in, Princeton's original Charter of 1746 and its amendments, from legislation, from the Board's own bylaws and from resolutions it passes from time to time, including those delegating authority to various officers of the University, the faculty and other members of the University community.

The Board has charge and control of the finances and funds of the University. It sets the operating and capital budgets and supervises the investment of the University's endowment, which is managed by the Princeton University Investment Company. All campus real estate and long-range physical planning, the determination of architectural styling and landscaping, and the general condition of the University's physical plant are directly overseen by the Board.

The Trustees exercise prior review and approval of substantial new claims on funds, on the allocation of any significant proportion of the University resources, and the setting of priorities for development, changes in instructional method with broad implications for the University, the determination of tuition and fees, changes in admission policies affecting sizeable categories of potential students, and changes in relations with outside educational and social institutions and government agencies.

The firm was also jointly recognized as Independent Agency of the Year for the Good Track, building on the momentum and success of last year when it was named Independent Agency of the Year for the Entertainment Track.

Edelman took home the Gold Lion for Vaselines ""See My Skin"" campaign, which challenges systemic racism and deep-rooted healthcare inequalities in the U.S. by creating the worlds first database designed to search for conditions on skins of color.

Alongside the Gold Lion, Edelman won a Bronze Lion for FELGTBs ""#REALVOICESOFPRIDE"" in the Media Lions; two Bronze Lions for National Grids ""The Green Light Signal"" in the PR Lions and the Creative Data Lions; and a Bronze Lion for Vaselines ""See My Skin"" in the Health and Wellness Lions. The firm placed 11 times on shortlists across 9 Lions where Edelman entered as the lead agency; and 45 times as partner/PR agency, which have translated into more medals across multiple categories.

Edelman shares Independent Agency of the Year honors for the Good Track with We Believe. The Good Track awards work that goes beyond brand purpose to use creative communications to shift culture, create change and positively impact the world. The award is calculated by the accumulation of points within the Good Track.

These honors are a testament to the firms commitment to delivering integrated work for clients through the continued investment in its multicultural, creative and planning capabilities. Its also an endorsement of Edelmans approach of Action Earns Trust, which is built on the notion that brands must stand for something and drive societal change. Edelman now has nearly 2,000 people in Data & Analytics, Digital, Creative and Planning, Multicultural, Impact and ESG.

Richard Edelman, CEO, Edelman said: This work is the perfect example of a brand taking action. When only 6 percent of image-based search results show skin conditions on people of color, it can lead to misdiagnosis and untreated conditions. Working with Vaseline to create the See My Skin tool, we created a solution that made a tangible and lasting impact. This recognition is a testament to our belief that brands that take action earn trust.

Judy John, Global Chief Creative Officer, Edelman & Cannes Lions PR Jury President said: ""This an incredibly important win for us. Its our dream to create transformative and sustainable ideas with our clients that can inspire positive impact. Thanks to our clients and team for the vision and perseverance to bring this idea to life.""

Fully ADA Compliant Truncated Dome Technology
Access Tile is the world leader in ADA compliant truncated dome and wayfinding detectable warning tiles. This achievement is a result of progressive product development based on extensive market feedback from accessibility professionals, specifiers, installers and end users over the past 30 years. Our unparalleled industry experience allows us to incorporate the most current material and manufacturing technologies to develop a cost-effective yet durable detectable warning tile that installs with ease. We offer multiple configurations of detectability products to ensure each installation is compliant with federal and local requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Our detectable warning systems easily fit into any area which is required to have truncated dome installations. Detectable warning panels serve as a distinctive warning for individuals with visual impairments. The truncated dome pattern carefully placed on detectable warning panels alert individuals of potential dangers, such as street crossings and curb drop-offs. Every tactile paving tile we produce complies with the ISO9000 manufacturing standards and commitment to quality.

Thats the power of intelligent design and precision engineering.

Fully ADA Compliant Truncated Dome Technology Video
Detectable Warning Tile Options
Replaceable Cast in Place Tiles
ADA Solution Replaceable Cast in Place Tile
Replaceable Cast in Place tiles are easily installed directly into wet set concrete and feature our industry-leading replaceability feature. These ADA tiles are perfect for projects which require long term, low-cost ADA compliant tiles.  All our Replaceable Cast in Place tiles are lightweight yet durable for all wet set concrete installations. This detectable warning tile meets all ADA requirements and is a reliable choice for any project. These tiles are the ideal choice for long-term sidewalk tile installation.

More Detail
Surface Applied Tiles
Our Surface Applied tiles (retrofit ADA tile)  are designed to install on top of any existing cured concrete surface where the implementation of a tactile detectable warning is required. Tile installation includes the use of our Tactile Bond and surface applied adhesive along with tamper proof stainless-steel Axius Fasters for long-term durability. The Surface Applied tile offers a simple, more cost-effective alternative to wet set Cast in Place tiles; when the only requirement is to include ADA compliant tiles on an existing concrete surface where all other accessibility requirements are present. Surface Applied tiles can be easily cut, allowing the installer flexibility when dealing with unforeseen site conditions; cutting the tiles does not void the warranty.
Surface Applied tiles make sidewalk tile installation a breeze.

ADA Solution Surface Applied Tile
Wayfinding Tiles
ADA Solution Tactile Systems Way finding Tile
Access Tiles directional wayfinding tiles (Directional Bar Tiles) are specifically designed to work in unison with the truncated dome tiles. These tactile walking surface indicators (TWSI) use a series of bar-shaped tactile surfaces, to create a detectable path. A tactile path allows access to all persons, between two spaces or locations. These paths are commonly designed with truncated dome tiles to indicate areas where the path begins, ends or splits so the visually disabled user can orient themselves to ensure they are following their desired path. These detectable warning tiles are extremely helpful in assisting the visually impaired navigate any space safely.

These come in both Surface Applied tiles and Replaceable Cast in Place tiles and can be used in place of ADA pavers. We have designed every directional wayfinding tile to maximize the functionality for guidance cane users.  Our unique sound on cane contact  feature, which uses sound reflection technology, creates an audible feedback every time the tile is tapped or swiped with a plastic tip guidance cane. Common uses of our directional wayfinding tiles are as pathways to transit stops, between buildings, to elevator call buttons, and more.

More Detail
Radius Curve Tiles
Radius Curve tiles come as both Replaceable Cast in Place and Surface Applied tiles. These tactile warning tiles are designed specifically to accommodate radius ADA compliant tile applications. They can be installed permanently into wet set concrete, or retrofitted into existing concrete surfaces, and feature our industry-leading replaceability feature. Our Radius Curve tiles are designed to work within a sidewalk tile installation which does not accommodate straight cuts. Like all our truncated dome detectable warning tiles, they are incredibly easy to handle, install, or replace, and come with everything you need for long term ADA compliance.  In order to best fit your unique radius needs these tiles can be cut in the field to conform to the required radius. Common uses of our Radius Curve tiles include curbs, pedestrian crossings, and transit platforms.

What is an ADA Tile?
ADA tiles are a generic term used for a truncated dome tactile detectable warning surface.  These truncated dome surfaces are designed to establish a physical cue for the visually disabled at the intersection of a pedestrian walkway and hazardous vehicular ways.  Sometimes called a tactile warning surface indicator (TWSI) this cue is proven to provide a signal unlike any other walking surface in the pedestrian environment.  The primary use of an ADA tile is to give a clear indicator when an individual is entering a hazardous vehicular way.  These ADA compliant tiles must be easily seen, felt underfoot and easily detected with guidance canes. The shape of truncated domes, aligned in an inline pattern, serve all these functions and have thus become industry standard. In order to enhance the visual effect of the surface, the color of the ADA tile must significantly contrast with the surrounding concrete surface. Each of Access Tiles tactile warning tiles are available in a variety of colors, to provide stark contrast in your project area. The sidewalk tile installation of Access Tile products is designed to outlast heavy foot traffic and provide long-term, high preforming guidance.

All our detectable warning tiles are entirely ADA compliant and designed to meet the federal and state ADA standards. Weve combined our proven polymer processing and material technologies, with intelligent design features, to create the most efficient, cost-effective detectable warning pavers on the market. To ensure the long term functionality, each tactile walking surface indicator (TWSI) is slip resistant, corrosion resistant, and abrasion resistant. All ADA warning surfaces have been rigorously tested using the AASHTO HS20-44 wheel load test, as well as various ASTM concrete tests and ASTM D tests. Individual truncated domes are tested further against wear and tear.

Each Access Tile product is shipped from our distributors with truncated dome installation instructions to ensure installation procedures are followed correctly to create a compliant transition, along with surface applied adhesive. A compliant transition is especially helpful for individuals with visual impairments because truncated domes can be felt through your shoes comfortably. We have also incorporated sound reflection technology into each TWSI, so persons with guidance canes can navigate the area completely unaided. Our detectable warning tiles can be found in public and private spaces worldwide, but some common applications include transit platforms, curbs, and pedestrian crossings, parking areas, and escalator and stair approaches/landings.

If you are looking for ADA compliant tiles for use in Canada, then please see Kinesik, the Canadian distributor of our detectable warning tiles.

Detectable Warning Systems of Many Names
Due to the variety of professions involved with implementing ADA compliance tactile-detectable warning surfaces have taken on many different terms, all describing the truncated dome surface. The following are a few examples customers use when referring to our Access Tile tactile detectable warning tile products:

Detectable warning mats, detectable warning tile, detectable warning surface

What are the ADA Regulations?
All Access Tile truncated dome tiles are explicitly designed to be compliant with all ADA regulations. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) became law in 1990, and recognizes the rights of all persons, regardless of ability, in every area of daily public life. This act was created to fight discrimination of disabled persons within society, specifically when it comes to transportation, employment, and all areas accessible to the general public. Due to legislation, infrastructure, and development codes at the time, many American citizens did not have equal access to all spaces. Thanks to the ADA standards, this is in the process of changing.

One of these standards calls for the installation of truncated dome tiles in any pedestrian space open to the public; including walkways, transitional spaces, transit platforms, vehicular parking garages, and more. The ADA states, to be compliant, each detectable warning tile must adhere to stringent size and spacing specifications. All ADA warning tiles must contrast with the adjacent walkway, as well as meet numerous measurement specific standards. In addition to the Federal ADA standards AccessTile complies with the California Title 24 Requirements, and the Public Right-of-Way (PROW).

For further information, please see our ADA regulation page, under the ADA resources tab of our website. You can also view the full, comprehensive Truncated Domes ADA Requirements on the official website.

Leadership

In 2021, Jeff Johnson was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to President of FSR. While COO, Johnson expanded the company into supporting additional federal agencies including the Department of Veterans Affairs.

With Johnson in place, FSR founder Tracy Balazs was able to retire. Balazs started FSR from inspiration working as a Registered Nurse at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, to solve a nursing shortage created by the need for military medical personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Balazs grew FSR from an award-winning, minority, women-owned small business recognized by the SBA, INC5000, and other organizations to a dynamic large business. Keystone contracts awarded include DHA MQS $7.5B IDIQ, Navy MATOS, Air Force CLASS, and many others.

Johnson has more than 18 years of federal healthcare management experience. He brings broad experience including management oversight and healthcare compliance, strategic planning, policy and program management, Federal budget best practices, Information Technology strategy, and overall healthcare management. He gained experience as a Federal employee with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Managing Director with Grant Thornton, and Account Manager with Leidos (LDOS $11.09B). In addition to his civilian career, Johnson retired in 2018 after serving 21 years with the Air National Guard.

We are excited for the growth Johnson brings in the next chapter of FSRs storied growth.

Quality Matters

FSR is firmly committed to conducting business with integrity and in compliance with the letter and spirit of the law.

FSR takes concerns of misconduct very seriously and expects that any individual who reports misconduct does so in good faith. Making a report in good faith means that you provide all the information you have regarding the issues and believe the report to be true.

FSR does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who, in good faith, reports known or suspected unethical or illegal misconduct, seeks advice, raises a concern, or provides information in an internal and external investigation or legal proceeding pertaining to the company.

The future of government depends on citizen experiences online and in-person. Investing in CX always means streamlined experience, heightened productivity, cost savings, and greater trust in leadership.

History
NAYGN was established in 1999 by seven young professionals. These young professionals wanted to create an organization that provided professional development, public information, knowledge transfer, recruiting and networking opportunities for the next generation of nuclear leaders.

Fueled by volunteers, the organization has grown to include dozens of continental committees and over a hundred local chapters facilitated by a board of directors affectionately known as The Core. This structure allows the organization to be flexible and serve a wide variety of members. The organization has conducted hundreds of thousands of hours of activities to educate the public and provided development opportunities at the local, regional, national and continental level.

Our Leadership
leader-detail
Buck Keswani
Chief Executive Officer
Buck Keswani grew up in a large Indian-Chinese family in Vienna. With all of his extended family members living on the same street, he was always surrounded by people and grew to appreciate the importance of human connection. His parents, who were also business owners, told him to never start a business. With that in mind, Buck founded Tantus Tech.

Bucks desire to start Tantus Tech stemmed from a recurring feeling of disconnect in delivery after his experiences working with other companies. He believed that clients deserved more: more passion, more attention, and better pricing. He knew that he could do things better, and after receiving project requests from ex-colleagues, he did.

Buck strongly believes in doing the right thing. And, to the best of his abilities, strives to treat everyone fairly, maintain his personal and professional integrity, and make a positive difference in the world.

WSC's state of the art 3KEYSOFTWARE technology has its roots in the nuclear and thermal power plant Operator Training Simulators. WSC will continue to invest a significant proportion of its profits in its products to add value to the engineering design and construction process through Simulator Assisted Engineering and to plant operation economics through simulation grounded equipment reliability and asset life cycle management processes.

The often promised and much publicized Nuclear Renaissance has now arrived and WSC has positioned itself with a number of strategically placed international partners to play a significant role in the development and construction of new nuclear power plants world-wide.
 
The projected growth in the Power Industry over the next fifteen years coincides with the bow wave of baby boomer retirement. WSC will continue to invest in new product development and introduce knowledge capture and educational software to support the industry's investment in recruitment and training for the next generation of operators and maintenance engineers. 

WSC's Mission is to meet or exceed customer requirements and expectations by

Providing innovative, state-of-the-art high-quality training simulators and simulation products to meet customer's operation, training and safety needs;

NO MORE HASSLE

No more calling the big cable or phone company when you have an issue or need service.
I worked at Comcast Business as a Business Account Executive and engaged numerous clients who simply wanted to simplify their essential communications services. Once I realized this was a business opportunity, I started Mitech while still an employee.

One Friday morning, my boss and sales director found out about my side hustle. So I was suspended WITH pay. The following Monday, I resigned and went full time with Mitech. Ive never looked back. 

Over 1000 clients later, were just getting started. 

A winning Psychology, Hustle and Discipline (PhD) will lead us to domination in this industry.

Environmental Remediation Services
Paragon provides a broad range of environmental science, geological, hydrogeological and engineering support to perform environmental assessments, resolve regulatory compliance issues and solve remediation problems for our clients.
About Paragon Professional Services
Paragon Professional Services, LLC (Paragon) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BSNC. Paragon received 8(a) certification from the Small Business Administration in August 2016. Paragon offers a wide range of environmental investigation, consulting, compliance, and remediation services as well as IT solutions, Facility O&M, Materiel Support, Supply and Security to both private- and public-sector clients throughout Alaska and the Continental U.S. Paragons experienced professional staff is dedicated to producing high-quality documentation and providing safe field execution to support its clients projects in line with local, state and federal guidelines and regulations.

Performance and Certifications
As the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has ruled in favor of allowing the evaluation of experience to consider past performance information regarding affiliated companies, and FAR 15.305(a) (2) (iii) allows the evaluation to consider key personnel who have relevant experience. This has allowed Paragon to build upon its sister companies while building its own environmental program. The performance of our sister companies is directly relevant to this effort because Paragon plans to use the resources of these companies on this contract in a meaningful manner when required.

Paragon and our sister companies have successfully negotiated numerous sole source contracts with our Government customers. Under 13 CFR 124.311(b), Alaska Native Corporation 8(a)s have unlimited sole source capability. Furthermore, FAR 19.805-1.2.b.2 stipulates that the $3M limit for 8(a) sole source contracts does not apply to Native American Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations and cannot be protested. This procurement method benefits all parties involved by streamlining the acquisition process as well as saving the Government time and money by not having to review numerous proposals and deal with delays caused by possible protests. Using our partnering methodology and fostering an open book relationship with our Government counterparts, the customer is guaranteed the ability to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, with none of the uncertainties associated with the competitive process alternative.

History
In 1997, Glenn Drayton was completing his doctoral thesis at the University of Canterbury. During his studies, he participated in an energy market research group with a strong focus on modeling. He began creating a rapid application development library, which allowed him to complete industrial-scale mathematical programming.

After his thesis, Glenn took a consulting role with a transmission system operator and quickly saw the need to test a range of designs in the energy market. In 1999, he expanded the original program written during his thesis and founded a company under the name Drayton Analytics. By mid-2000, the first version of PLEXOS was released.

Before long, PLEXOS was officially adopted by the Irish SEM as its modeling standard and the software began developing a global presence. Demand was also increased dramatically by the effects of the California energy crisis in 2002.

In 2006, Drayton Analytics transformed its business plan and was renamed to Energy Exemplar. Energy Exemplar grew its customer base in the United States and Europe by opening three regional offices with in-time-zone support.

The company achieved a major milestone in 2015, when the 1,000th installation of PLEXOS was completed. This made PLEXOS the most widely used energy market software in the world.

Two years later, this success caught the attention of the Riverside Company, a private equity group who acquired Energy Exemplar. As part of the growth plan, Energy Exemplar also acquired EPIS, LLC. The EPIS platform, Aurora, complemented the PLEXOS suite and increased brand recognition across the United States and Canada.

Since then, Energy Exemplar has more than doubled in size. The company continues to grow and achieve its goal of becoming the leading end-to-end, integrated solution provider.

Diamond Band Saws
The Gryphon Diamond Band Saw is the industry's most popular diamond band saw and is available in four distinct versions.

The thin band has diamonds coated to the leading edge, which enables the saw to make fast, very thin and precise cuts in material.

This versatile saw is used extensively for cutting glass, stone, tile and similar hard material.

It is used by hobbyists, professional artists, medical labs, construction workers, and fraggers among others.

A special version of the saw has been developed for cutting live coral, where salt water must be used for cooling.

The saw is also available with extended height for additional clearance.

Diamond Wire Saws
Stacks Image 23
A wire saw offers the ability to cut in any direction by virtue of its round blade with diamonds coating the entire surface.

Gryphon offers two distinctly different styles of wire saw.

The Zephyr Ring Saw uses a circular blade, something like a small diamond-coated Hula-Hoop, which revolves continuously.

The Omni-2 Wire Saw uses a very inexpensive straight blade that moves up and down rapidly.

Diamond Grinders
Gryphon offers three distinctly different styles of grinders. Our most popular model is the simple and very affordable Gryphette. It features a powerful motor that can handle any job in your studio. Its small size is also a welcome feature.

Our middle model, the Studio Grinder has a larger motor and an innovative water delivery system.

Our Convertible Grinder, shown at the right, can be configured with a horizontal work surface like other grinders, or can be assembled with the work surface tilted as shown. This allows the operator a better view of their work. The grinder can be used while seated which provides much greater comfort to the operator. An electric pump keeps the bit wet in any orientation.

Wet Belt Sander
This Gryphon product presents an entirely new category of tool for the glass artist. With the large grinding belt, offering a huge 90 square inches of grinding surface, you can now accurately grind straight lines or true up large curved surfaces quickly and easily. A small platform helps steady your work and tilts for easy beveling. A variety of belts are available from coarse for fast grinding to ultra smooth for polishing.

Abrasive Miter Saw
Stacks Image 49
The Gryphon Miter saw is particularly well suited for making premium cuts in thin wall extrusions of brass, zinc, steel and copper. It has a very fine abrasive blade which cuts cleanly and coolly resulting in a minimum of flash.

The saw is used largely in the stained glass (for cutting the zinc or brass came used to join separate pieces of glass) and the automotive fields (for cutting tubing of all types including braided stainless hose). Golf professionals use the saw for cutting graphite club handles. A large adjustable table provides settings for accurate angles. The chop saw design along with the built in clamp for the work and safety shield provide protection to the operator.

Diamond Grinding Bits and Core Drills
Gryphon is proud to be able to offer a line of high quality grinding bits for all standard glass grinders.

Gryphon offers a choice of its innovative Slip-On bits, or traditional bits.

The Slip-On bits require no tools to install or remove. They simply drop into place. When you wish to remove them, they just lift right off. No other bit system is as easy to use.

A full line of standard bits is also available.
Available are 1"", and 3/4"" Cylindrical Bits, Mirror Grinding Bits, Groove Bits, and 1/4"" and 1/8"" Grinding Pins. Many of these bits are offered in a choice three or four grits: Extra Fine, Fine, Standard and Super Power. "

Our Story
Growing up the daughter of a tribal chairman of the San Pasqual Band of Mission Indians, Tribal Tech and Cowan and Associates, Owner and Chairwoman, Victoria (Vicki) Vasques developed a deep understanding of the needs of Native American communities and the lack of informed private sector services dedicated to meeting those needs. From early in her career as an educator, Vicki advocated tirelessly for not only her own community, but the wider Native American community of diverse individuals and close-knit tribal groups. American Indian/Alaska Native communities are at the very heart of every service Tribal Tech provides, and though we have expanded our reach over the years and continue to effect change across the whole of the United States, our heritage remains the core of who we are.

Osiyo!
The Cherokee Nation is a sovereign tribal government. Upon settling in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) after the Indian Removal Act, the Cherokee people established a new government in what is now the city of Tahlequah, Oklahoma. A constitution was adopted on September 6, 1839, 68 years prior to Oklahomas statehood.

Today, the Cherokee Nation is the largest tribe in the United States with more than 390,000 tribal citizens worldwide. More than 141,000 Cherokee Nation citizens reside within the tribes reservation boundaries in northeastern Oklahoma. Services provided include health and human services, education, employment, housing, economic and infrastructure development, environmental protection and more. With approximately 11,000 employees, Cherokee Nation and its subsidiaries are one of the largest employers in northeastern Oklahoma. The tribe had a more than $2.16 billion economic impact on the Oklahoma economy in fiscal year 2018.

MISSION:

The Cherokee Nation is committed to protecting our inherent sovereignty, preserving and promoting Cherokee culture, language and values, and improving the quality of life for the next seven generations of Cherokee Nation citizens.

About The Nation
Cherokee Nation Home >About The Nation
Cherokee Nation is the sovereign government of the Cherokee people. We are the largest of three federally recognized Cherokee tribes and are based in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the capital of the Cherokee Nation. Our headquarters are located in the historic W.W. Keeler Tribal Complex, with sub-offices and service sites throughout Cherokee Nations 14-county reservation area.

Originally located in the southeastern United States in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, the Cherokee Nation was forced to relocate to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in 1838 after gold was discovered in our homelands. The thousand-mile forced removal became known as the Trail of Tears and came at a cost of nearly 4,000 Cherokee lives through sickness and harsh travel conditions.

Today, Cherokee Nation is one of the largest employers in northeast Oklahoma and is the largest tribal nation in the country. As the governing body of the Cherokee people, the Cherokee Nation has the right to structure its own government and constitution; make and enforce its own laws; regulate business, land, environment, and wildlife; and impose taxes within the Cherokee Nations jurisdiction.

The Cherokee Nation also provides for the safety of its citizens, other residents and visitors through its law enforcement agency, the Cherokee Nation Marshal Service. The Marshal Service has jurisdiction throughout the tribes 14-county reservation and is cross-deputized with more than 90 federal, state, county and city law enforcement offices to provide seamless services to everyone in the area.

The Cherokee Nation government, like the United States government, consists of three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. The three branches are separate and distinct, providing a checks-and-balance system. The tribes business arm, Cherokee Nation Businesses, operates a variety of businesses, including gaming and manufacturing, and combined with tribal government figures, employ about 11,000 people in northeast Oklahoma. The Cherokee Nations total economic impact in Oklahoma in the fiscal year 2018 was $2.16 billion.

THIS IS KATMAI
WHO ARE WE? Katmai is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ouzinkie (you-ZINK-ee) Native Corporation (ONC). The majority of ONC Shareholders who live in Ouzinkie are lifelong residents of the village of Ouzinkie, Alaska. The people of Ouzinkie are Alutiiq (a-LOO-tik) by ancestry, meaning they are a group of Native Alaskans who have made their home in and around the coastal areas of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska for the past 7,000 years. Working for Katmai means promoting the cultural and economic stability of one of Alaskas great indigenous peoples.

Katmai was initially formed in 2007 by ONC to hold and manage its interests in companies and joint ventures which contract with the US Federal Government. KGS is charged with producing profits through the acquisition and successful management of US Federal contracts or other commercial efforts, which are distributed to ONC. ONC, an Alaska native village corporation, determines how to distribute those profits such that they benefit ONC Shareholders.

HOW IS KATMAI PRONOUNCED? Katmai is pronounced KAT-my. Although the companys full name is Katmai Government Services (or KGS), the organization is referred to as simply Katmai. The name Katmai derives from an early Native settlement located near present-day Katmai National Park and Preserve that was abandoned after the Novarupta volcano erupted in 1912, forcing many locals to move across the ocean strait to establish what is now the current community of Ouzinkie. Katmai is thus seen as an important ancestral home for many of the people of Ouzinkie.

GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC SAFETY
National, state, and provincial governments send their workers to places where most people never venture. With them goes valuable equipment, from vehicles and heavy machinery to specialized sensors that gather data on everything from vehicle run-time to temperature and rainfall.  That equipment is vulnerable to theft and misuse, just as the workers are vulnerable to harm and the challenges of working remotely. The satellite powered solutions from Globalstar provide scalable options for asset tracking and communications.

 Company History
Hopewell Designs began operations in 1994 to supply irradiator systems for calibrating radiation survey meters and dosimeters.  In 1996, we completed the design, manufacture, and commissioning of the Automated Irradiator System (AIS) at the Health Physics Instrument Calibration Laboratory at US Department of Energy Savannah River Site. The AIS was the most modern instrument calibration system in the United States, and still remains one of the top calibration laboratories throughout the world. It consists of nine different irradiator systems for gamma, X-ray, beta, and neutron.  With a common user interface, all systems are easy to operate and automated to increase efficiency and reduce errors. Additional equipment included an environmental monitoring system, a calibration and characterization system, radiation monitoring, safety interlocks, and video monitoring. Hopewell Designs, Inc. was responsible for all aspects of the AIS including system design, project management, coordination with building contractor, radiation shielding design, manufacturing, installation, testing, and training.  In 2000 and 2001, we commissioned similar systems for the Los Alamos National Lab and the Idaho National Lab. These projects, which lasted over two years, met all major milestones and were installed on time and within budget.

Beginning in 2005, Hopewell Designs began offering our systems to the international community. We have now installed systems in over 66 countries at primary and secondary standards laboratories.  Customers have included:

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), United States
National Resource Council, Canada
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
Department of Energy Laboratories, 12 different labs, United States
Australian Radiation Protection & Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA)
Environmental Protection Agency of Ireland
Federal Authority of Nuclear Radiation, United Arab Emirates
Health Science Authority in Singapore
Institut Rudjer Boskovic, Croatia
Kazakhstan Atomic Energy Commission
Tanzania Atomic Energy Commission
Ministry of Health, Romania
Over the years, we have continued to build our portfolio of products and services to better serve our customers.  We have supplied several hundred systems in the United States and throughout the world. Installed irradiator systems include: X-ray beam, gamma beam, neutron/gamma low scatter, box calibrator, well, and beta irradiators. We have developed other types of equipment that includes:  test and measurement systems, industrial X-ray inspection equipment, and industrial automation equipment.

We continue to develop our team of professionals to offer a broad range of technical services that complements our product line for a complete solution for our customers.  We assist with radiation calibration, shielding analysis, calibration laboratory design, and customer service. With our outstanding service and support, we help our customers achieve their goals, keep operating at optimum efficiency and quality, and remain satisfied with our products and support.

HISTORY

Our story
CAST Transportation started out as South Park Motor Lines.  The company was founded in 1948 by husband and wife Richard H. and Lois Eshe Lody. Lodys father, Walter Schattinger, founded a truck line in South Park called Schattinger and Son.  He strongly encouraged his daughter to carry on the tradition.  Lody and Richard had the routine down, Richard drove the trucks while Lody ran the office and at times was recruited as a driver when the work piled up. They made a great team!  Richard and Lody passed this passion of trucking on to their son Rick.

The company is still family owned by their son Richard Eshe Rick.  Rick has taken CAST Transportation to the top of the trucking industry, serving customers nationwide including Canada.  CAST is located in Henderson Colorado, just northeast of downtown Denver on 35 acres which is lighted and secured.  CAST also has its own rail spur serviced by the BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) Railroad. From the rail siting, transloading services are performed both rail-to-truck and truck-to-rail. The facility contains CASTs Dispatch, Operations, Safety, Executive offices and a 24 hour full-service shop.

"American Centrifuge Operating, Llc",541715,Maryland,Yes,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Yes,Yes,none,https://www.centrusenergy.com/,"American Centrifuge
Centrus is working with the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop and demonstrate a highly-efficient uranium enrichment gas centrifuge technology with an important role to play for the national security and energy security of the United States and its allies around the world.

This technology  called the American Centrifuge  could restore Americas domestic uranium enrichment capability for both national security and commercial purposes.  Originally developed by the U.S. Department of Energy in the 1980s and significantly upgraded by Centrus over a 15-year period, these are the most advanced centrifuges in the world.  Their deployment would put the United States at the forefront of uranium enrichment technology.

A National Security Imperative
The United States, which for decades led the world in uranium enrichment, shut down the last of its outdated and increasingly uneconomical Cold War-era enrichment plants in 2013  leaving the nation without a domestic, industrial-scale uranium enrichment capability for national security purposes for the first time since the Manhattan Project.

While current market conditions do not support building a full-scale uranium enrichment plant for  commercial purposes, the United States needs an industrial enrichment capability for many  reasons   including providing a fuel source for advanced reactors, strengthening energy security, supporting its nonproliferation policy, providing fuel for the long-term needs of the nuclear Navy, and providing the tritium needed to maintain the effectiveness of Americas nuclear deterrent.

The American Centrifuge technology is the only technology now available to restore this critical capability. An October 2015 report by the U.S. Department of Energy found that Centrus AC100 centrifuge is the most technically advanced and lowest risk option to meet the nations long term national security needs.

A Partnership to Develop the American Centrifuge
Centrus has been working with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Departments Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance the American Centrifuge technology.

In early 2016, Centrus completed a successful three-year demonstration of a full, 120 machine cascade of advanced centrifuges at its Piketon, Ohio, facility, demonstrating the long-term performance and reliability of the machines under actual operating conditions.  Informed by data from that work, Centrus scientists, engineers, and operators are utilizing the Companys unique facilities in Tennessee to continue advancing the technology  identifying further improvements to reduce costs, improve manufacturability, and enhance long-term reliability of its enrichment operations. The work also ensures that critical U.S. expertise in centrifuge design, manufacturing, and operations continues to advance.

Centrus ongoing work on the technology is supported under a contract with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to continue the development, operation and demonstration of the American Centrifuge so that it can ultimately be deployed, when needed, to support U.S. national security requirements."

Welcome to STC Environmental Services, Inc. We have been providing environmental consulting services to the business community since 1992.

STC's primary focus is commercial real estate. However, School Districts, Federal facilities, and municipalities are also a fair percentage of our clientele. To a lesser degree, we also help residential land owners.

Assessment of contaminated real estate requires a broad knowledge of several fields outside real estate, including state and federal environmental law, insurance and liability issues, public perceptions of health risks, chemistry and biology. It also requires the ability to work in tandem with attorneys, architects, and other professionals.



Few firms have the knowledge and experience to evaluate contaminated properties. STC Environmental Services has that knowledge and experience, and we stake our reputation on providing accurate and reliable assessments of real estate. If you have bought or currently own commercial real estate, then you have probably hired a consultant like STC.


The majority of services provided by STC fall into one of three categories of commercial property development or building management, which are:

Phase I Assessments - The environmental evaluation of commercial real estate prior to purchase or refinancing.

Phase II/III Assessments - Soil and groundwater testing of commercial and industrial properties when contamination is known or suspected.
Asbestos, Mold, and Lead Assessment of commercial and public buildings.

 ABOUT US
STC's primary focus is commercial real estate. However, School Districts, Federal Facilities, and municipalities are also a fair percentage of our clientele. To a lesser degree, we also help residential land owners.

If you have bought or currently own commercial real estate, then you have probably hired a consultant like STC. The majority of services provided by STC fall into one of three categories of commercial property development or building management, which are:

Phase I Assessments - The environmental assessment of commercial real estate prior to purchase or refinancing.
Phase II/III Assessments - Soil and groundwater testing of commercial and industrial properties when contamination is known or suspected
Asbestos, Mold and Lead Assessment of commercial and public buildings and associated abatement efforts.
Indoor Air Quality Assessments
The staff of STC consists of geologists, environmental scientists and technicians. We're a consulting firm and not a contractor, so our focus is the initial evaluation of environmental concerns (e.g. Phase I Assessments, asbestos inspections), and then monitoring/supervision of the contractor's abatement or remediation efforts (e.g. asbestos abatement, soil excavation).

2012 marked our 20th anniversary in the industry, so we have literally brought hundreds of commercial and industrial projects to successful completion. When selecting a professional for a project, we feel it's important to find someone that does that job every day, not once a month, not once a quarter, and has seen just about every facet or problem that could be encountered. In this way, we think we have a distinct advantage over our competitors that offer environmental consulting as a side line or small branch of their core business.

STC is licensed and registered to perform most all regulated environmental consulting activities in the State of Texas. STC's sole office is the corporate office located on Research Drive in San Antonio. Due to travel costs, we are most competitive in south and central Texas. However, even if your project is in Abilene, Houston, or Dallas, please give us a call and ask for a proposal. You might be surprised. We have a number of clients that will use us exclusively in all regions of Texas.

History
Innovative Research, Inc. was founded in 1987 by Dr. Suhas V. Patankar with the mission to offer Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software and services for the analysis of flow and thermal phenomena in practical engineering processes. Over the years, we have developed computational models for fluid flow and heat transfer, chemical reactions, and melting and solidification in a wide range of practical applications such as Nuclear Reactors, Chemical Vapor Infiltration for Manufacturing of Ceramic Matrix Composites, Automobile Compressors, Aircraft Ventilation, and Electronics Cooling. In the past fifteen years, we have focused on developing application-specific software packages MacroFlow, TileFlow, MeltFlow-VAR/ESR that enable practicing engineers to obtain significant productivity improvements in the design process.

Innovative Research, LLC was formed in 2014 through a reorganization of Innovative Research, Inc. to focus on software products MacroFlow, MeltFlow-VAR, and MeltFlow-ESR, and undertake related Research & Development Projects.

Activities
Our mission is to develop and offer highest-quality software products and undertake computational flow modeling services that provide significant productivity benefits and engineering value to the practicing engineers. Our product offerings and activities include the following.

MacroFlow uses the technique of Flow Network Modeling (FNM) for a rapid flow and thermal analysis of electronics cooling and engineering flow systems. It is widely used for the design of cooling systems for computer and defense electronics, gas and liquid delivery systems in semiconductor processing, and filtration and fuel delivery systems.

MeltFlow-VAR and MeltFlow-ESR utilize advanced CFD techniques for comprehensive analysis of the Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) and Electroslag Remelting (ESR) processes. Leading metal producers worldwide are using these software tools for process design and optimization to produce high-quality ingots of superalloys, steels, and Titanium alloys.

We also undertake Research and Development Projects with Government Agencies and Industrial Organizations. In such projects, we develop advanced computational models for analysis of complex flow and thermal phenomena in Single-Phase and Two-Phase Electronics Cooling, Metallurgical Processing of High-Performance Alloys, and related applications.

Our staff consists of research engineers with advanced degrees, who are involved in product development, marketing, and technical support. "

ACCO History
ACCO Engineered Systems was founded in 1934 as Air Conditioning Company (ACCO), a proprietorship, by Ira Prentiss Fulmor at 1005 Santa Fe Street, Los Angeles. The former name of the company was chosen to indicate what the company did because few people knew about air conditioning. In 1949, the business moved from downtown Los Angeles to Glendale where it transformed from an air conditioning distributor to become an independent corporation.  After 70 years in Glendale, ACCO moved to its headquarters to 888 East Walnut Street in Pasadena.  Jeffrey Marrs became ACCOs fifth President & CEO in 2016.

Over the years ACCO has expanded its leadership role in the design, installation, and service of industrial, commercial, high-rise, residential, and institutional air conditioning, heating, ventilation, plumbing, process piping, electrical and DDC control systems. ACCOs name was changed in 2002 to ACCO Engineered Systems to better reflect the many aspects of its business. A national trade publication has consistently ranked ACCO among the 3 largest heating, ventilating, and air conditioning contractors in the nation. The company, including its subsidiaries, has an average of 3,000 employees, and offices and manufacturing campuses that occupy more than 20 acres, spanning 32 locations.

ACCOs mechanical systems occupy facilities in a wide variety of industries, including commercial office space, biopharmaceutical R&D, semi-conductor, micro-electronics, medical/healthcare centers, manufacturing plants, entertainment, retail, telecommunications, education, data centers, and high rise residential.

ACCO has completed work in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Washington D.C., and Mexico."

About Delta Linen Supply, Inc.

All About Delta Linen and more

Delta Linen Inc. was established by the Randall family in 1948. Raymond Randall Sr. and Raymond Jr. opened University Dry Cleaners on Central and University in Albuquerque. The small dry cleaning business flourished until the late 1960s. The marketplace changed and dry cleaning wasnt in high demand for the college students as it had been in the late 40s and 50s. In 1968, Raymond Randall Jr. and Raymond Randall III moved the business to its current location on Candelaria, with the new name Delta.

Delta evolved into an industrial uniform and dust control business which served the Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Los Alamos areas. Delta maintained over 350 accounts with thousands of clients in uniforms. In the 1990s Delta opened the first discount dry cleaning store which had the largest capacity in the state. In 2005, Raymond Randall III and his daughter Shelly (Randall) Snyder saw the market changing. The decision was made to take the business into industrial linen rental. The industrial uniform rental business was sold and the discount dry cleaning was closed.

The entire focus of Delta became industrial linen rental and hospitality garments. Raymond and Shelly are committed to offering something new in the marketplace.

We know that sometimes youre going to have an emergency problem come up that just cant wait. We dont believe you should be punished for a situation that wasnt your fault. Thats why we offer emergency service 24/7, 365 days a year. Whats the point of having a plumbing and HVAC contractor if theyre not going to show up when the problem actually occurs, right? We dont just offer our services when its convenient for us to do so. We are at your service at all times because we care about your quality of life.
For additional protection, we offer a maintenance agreement with a 15% discount on services, no emergency fees, and a free yearly inspection, among other benefits! This allows you to get the most out of your money, by ensuring that any unexpected problems (as most of them are) are handled at a reduced cost to you. Our maintenance agreement is a wise choice for anyone who is looking to cut down on their yearly maintenance costs, which should be everyone.
Dont just take our word for it, though!
 We are also backflow certified, Word Flex certified, Air Bound certified, members of the BBB, and highly rated on Angies List. We go the extra mile to be respected by our peers, as well as our customers, because we take pride in what we do.

Here's What Our Clients Say:
MAGNOLIA IS FULL SERVICE,
including air conditioning, heating, plumbing and subcontracting for flues and chimney lining. I had a very old gas water heater and they replaced it within 2 days from doing an audit and even when I requested a switch to electric from gas at the last minute it was no problem. Pasquale is a professional and took care of every aspect, replaced leaking pipes, brought my gas boiler flue up to code and installed a high grade water heater; their pricing is very competitive.
Barbara B
WE CALLED MAGNOLIA TO HELP US WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IN OUR HOME.
Mario was incredibly professional and clean while working. He was kind and made sure we fully understood what was happening each step of the way. I would absolutely use this company again for future needs and highly recommend Mario! "

CHARGE FORWARD
Our Training Approach
PN&A, Inc. believes the greatest degree of learning occurs in an environment of reciprocal respect. Disrespectful behavior and commentary mitigate against the learning experience. As presenters, we seek to increase our audiences knowledge base to a level that enables well-informed decision-making.

Our Foundational Premises:
Information vs. Attitude
Mercy vs. Justice
Benefit of the Doubt vs. Assumption of Guilt
Each of the foundational premises, or the means of achieving the goals and adhering to the philosophy statement, derives from one consistent assumption regarding conflict. It is presumed frequently that conflict is an inherently negative thing. PN&A, Inc. encourages workshop participants to view conflict as a potentially positive element; one that is essential for growth. Hence, these three foundational premises emerge from that positive assumption.

ABOUT US
 

Since 1986, PN&A, Inc. has accrued in-depth management consulting, training, and implementation experience in myriad public and private sector arenas. A frequent and consistent focus of this work has involved the design and development of effective training that transforms organizations vertically, horizontally, and diagonally across all stakeholder levels-from key executive leadership positions through line operation employees and end-users.

 

 

01. STRATEGIC
Working through the intersection of organizational development tools including 508 compliant pre/post online climate and 360 assessments; individual coaching; team facilitation; customized case studies and off-site retreats, PN&A, Inc. helps each client organization visualize, implement, and manifest its unique transformational vision.

02. PROFESSIONAL
PN&A, Inc. has worked successfully with U.S.-based multi-nationals; large, decentralized federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, Defense Logistics Agency, and the EPA; state and municipal government entities; as well as colleges, universities, and non-profit, service-based organizations.

03. CONFIDENTIAL
By design, PN&A, Inc. is small and severely client-focused; we limit the number of client projects to ensure consistent attention to detail from customized project inception to transformative completion. We exceed client expectations at each point of engagement each and every time.

PN&A, Inc. was founded in Jacksonville, Florida as a research and information resource center for diverse organizations and industries. Within the first eighteen months PN&A, Inc. provided industry-specific research and presentations on technical topics such as selling financial services through telemarketing, developing effective workshops for post-secondary academic faculty, as well as generic training in stress and time management, communication skills, team building, and leadership development.  During 1988, PN&A, Inc. began receiving requests for information on business ethics, workforce demographics, and multicultural diversity. As the firm increased its level of research and writing in these fields, their interdependency became apparent. The level of synergy between these new fields with our existing areas of expertise was exciting. The then current and projected demographic trends indicated new challenges and opportunities for U.S. based organizations. The implications of those challenges and opportunities spoke to both domestic and international considerations.

In concept, diversity, unlike its predecessors, affirmative action, EEO, and race relations, has a decidedly fiscal application. With a shrinking, less educated and more diverse workforce, diversity has become more than a human resource department concern. Diversity, the presence of difference in a given environment (commonly based on ones gender, race, age, physical condition, and ethnicity), directly affects productivity which, in turn, impacts profit margins. The greater the degree of diversity, the greater the degree of impact. The impact is seen in communication, team building, conflict management and resolution issues, all of which affect productivity. Also visible is the effect on the moral and ethical dimensions of organizations, both internally and externally.

Traditionally, business ethics has been viewed from a Eurocentric perspective, both in academic circles and in practical application. This perspective is not consistent always with the perspectives or world views of people of color, whether African-Americans, Asians, Hispanics or Native Americans. Ethical and moral perspectives or frameworks have culturally-based origins. As organizations become more diverse, the diversity of perspectives will expand, intersect and sometimes conflict. This expansion, intersection and potential conflict directly impacts the internal climate of employee interactions as well as the external climate in marketing and sales decisions in domestic and global markets.

Not only have we provided management consulting services to hundreds of organizations, but also broad-based training to thousands of managers and employees.  I invite you to call or email us for references, scope/feasibility proposals, availability, or prompt responses to any questions or other details not addressed here.  In the specific area of diversity, we have compiled a significant amount of statistical research data. PN&A, Inc.s diversity, productivity and profitability programs present bottom line issues and opportunities to improve the efficient utilization of human resources. When the maximization of resources is mandated, we can identify behaviors based on isms for what they are, counter-productive.  A conscious dedication and commitment to excellence is the hallmark of organizations planning for a profitable future in a competitive marketplace. PN&A, Inc. is in the business of helping organizations move from the actuality of today to the potentiality of tomorrow. Let us serve you by assisting in that transition.

RSS feeds for news, patches The seeds of PowerWorld Simulator were planted in the early 1990s, when Professor Thomas Overbye of the University of Illinois saw the need for a better tool to help students understand the workings of large-scale power systems. The software of the day relied heavily on numbers and charts that required further interpretation and explanation. Missing was a visual experience that could be easily understood.

PowerWorld Corporation was founded in 1996 by Professor Overbye, two of his colleagues, and a doctoral student in the Universitys Power and Energy Systems research area. Professor Overbye continues to provide guidance and vision and is intimately involved with the design and development of our software. He has attained numerous accolades in academic and business circles for his contributions to teaching, research, and the commercialization of technology, holding a University professorship sponsored by business leaders and philanthropists Peter and Kim Fox. The erstwhile doctoral student, Mark Laufenberg, PhD, still serves as our president. Professor Overbye has since been elected to the prestigious U.S. National Academy of Engineering in recognition of his work in the integration of visualization and analysis tools for power systems.

Weve since grown and our tools are fully commercial-grade, but our original foundations of simplicity and best-in-class visualization still guide the development of every element of our software and our approach to power system consulting services. We now have over 1,000 customers in 70 countries, representing electric utilities, independent system operators, government agencies, generation and transmission developers, power marketers and traders, legal and policy consultants, and academia "

MEET OUR SHAREHOLDER
The Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes
The Flathead Indian Reservation is home to three tribes, the Bitterroot Salish, Upper Q?ispe?, and the Kootenai. The territories of these three tribes covered all of western Montana and extended into parts of Idaho, British Columbia, and Wyoming. The Hellgate Treaty of 1855 established the Flathead Reservation, but over half a million acres passed out of Tribal ownership during land allotment that began in 1904.

 

The subsistence patterns of our Tribal people developed over generations of observation, experimentation, and spiritual interaction with the natural world, creating a body of knowledge about the environment closely tied to seasons, locations, and biology. This way of life was suffused with rich oral history and a spiritual tradition in which people respected the animals, plants, and other elements of the natural environment. By learning from our Elders and teaching our children, those Tribal ways of life continue to this day.

Our founder, Jon Paulsen, MS, CPE, started SquareGrove Office Furniture in 2002 when, as an Ergonomics Engineer, he saw many people buying ergonomic products without understanding how they were helping from an ergonomics perspective. In the beginning, Jon was a one man e-commerce store. He knew ergonomics but had no idea how to run a business except for a desire to offer exceptional customer service and expert advice. Luckily, Jons ergonomic engineering background, along with his focus on serving and educating his customers, translated well into running a business and the company has grown from there.

Monday - Friday | 9 am - 5 pm PRESS RELEASE

June 25, 2018

 

WINDSOR MILL, MD.   Concurrent with the retirement of its majority stock holder, The Lawrence A. Beck Company will cease manufacturing and accepting new orders effective June 29, 2018.

 

All customer lists and pertinent order history information has been forwarded to Archetype, LLC, (an awards, apparel, specialties and print company) for future reorder and manufacture.

 

Several former employees of The Lawrence A. Beck Company will be joining the Archetype team. George Politz (george@archetype360.com), Dave Kelbaugh (dave@archetype360.com), Archie Staymates (archie@archetype360.com), Jeanne Politz (jeanne@archetype360.com) and Jay Gilliss (jay@archetype360.com)  can all be reached by calling 443.478.7200. 

 

From the time he opened his doors in 1951, Larry Beck was known to all as the ""The Trophy King"". Mr. Beck was grateful for every customer and wanted no less than your total satisfaction. A nationwide vendor of Trophies, Awards, Plaques, Recognition Products, Promotional Products, Corporate Apparel and Tradeshow Giveaways, the Beck Family built a reputation for quality, craftsmanship, fair pricing and exemplary customer service. It has been an absolute privilege to serve you for the past 68 years!

 

Providing a seamless transition for Larry Beck customers has been priority #1 since making the decision to retire. After conversation and interview with many local award and trophy shops, Archetype provided the best opportunity for Beck customers to experience uninterrupted service. Archetype has a nearby storefront (5 minutes from the Beck showroom) and is committed to maintaining pricing structures currently in place for Larry Beck customers. 

 

Archetype, LLC (3535 Brenbrook Drive in Randallstown, MD), looks forward to moving The Lawrence A. Beck company legacy forward with the acquisition of customer records and the addition of several employees. We appreciate the opportunity to earn your business and to build on your long-standing relationship with The Beck Company.

Our History
Divider text here	
1984    Gene Waller establishes Technomics, Inc. and opens its first office in Santa Barbara, California. John Horak, a former colleague joins the company a couple of years later. Together Gene and John put the company on the map by specializing in research and development of cost estimating databases and techniques for high-value ship, air, space, and ground-based electronics systems.

2000    Rick Collins, leveraging over 20 years of independent cost estimating, evaluation, and research experience for employee-owned Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and then the Naval Center for Cost Analysis (NCCA), opens an office in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia. He and two former NCCA colleagues, who join him on day one, create a buzz that soon attracts new clients and other former colleagues looking for a better opportunity. Based on Rick's positive experience at SAIC in the 1980s, the company takes the first step to becoming employee-owned by extending ownership opportunities to high performing employees at all experience levels.

2005    Technomics grows its reputation for doing great, honest technical work and hiring talented, respected senior analysts and high potential entry level analysts with quantitatively oriented degrees and strong academic records. Our smart growth model (i.e., grow only as fast as our ability to hire good people) pays dividends in the form of new Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD clients (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Government Accountability Office) and in new employees attracted by having an impact on a smaller organization that is committed to technical excellence as THE means to growth.

2010    Technomics takes the next step to broad-based employee ownership by establishing an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which provides every employee an ownership stake in the form of a second retirement savings plan. This step reinforces the company's commitment to fostering a culture that motivates, retains, and attracts top talent. The company continues to grow smartly by adding talented staff at all experience levels, adding non-DoD clients (Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration), and addressing client needs in new areas (systems engineering, project management, and data visualization). The company expands efforts to improve the cost analysis community of practice via active participation in the International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association (ICEAA).

 
2014    In recognition of the continuing need to attract and to retain the best talent, Technomics implements a robust Career Progression Model (CPM) that provides staff the opportunity to plan for a Technomics career along either a technical or management path with a full understanding of what it means and requires to progress along the chosen path. The CPM and associated Performance Management System are well received by our employee owners who have a vested interest in owning their own careers and in growing with the company.

2015    Technomics celebrates the Arlington office's 15th anniversary and the company's 15th consecutive year of revenue, income, and stock price growth  an impressive track record, particularly in light of the increasingly competitive government professional services marketplace that adversely impacted many other companies. In recognition of this reality, Technomics, initiates an effort to deliver increasing value to its clients by creating distinctive, analytics-based service offerings that differentiate the company from the rest of the pack. Employee owners embrace this important multi-year initiative to create enduring value for our clients in the form of better decisions faster.

2017    Technomics continues to achieve tremendous success in 2017. Growing profitably for the 17th consecutive year by virtue of thoughtful business decisions, including but not limited to, shunning low price technically acceptable opportunities that our competition deemed critical to their existence in favor of discerning clients who recognize and appreciate the Technomics difference. Speaking of what distinguishes us from the rest of the pack, Technomics expands its investment in creating greater value for clients by establishing the Data Analytics and Technology Solutions (DATS) practice, which exploits the unique problem solving qualifications of our analysts to not only perform analysis but also design and develop innovative data solutions that address other analysts needs. These are but two of the distinctive aspects of Technomics that contribute to the company eclipsing the 100 analyst landmark in early summer. The combination of continuing growth and commitment to employee-owner satisfaction in the form of ascetically appealing workspace conducive to collaboration, productivity, and fun fuels a year-end move to trendy open office space with panoramic top-floor views of Washington D.C. and Arlington, Virginia.

Business Operations
Our mission is to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society including the progress of science and technology, and the preservation of the global environment and resources through the provision of highly-original products, analytical and measurement solutions, and engineering services that utilize our world renowned measurement and analytical technologies. We have business operations in the fields of Energy & Environment, Bio & Healthcare and Materials & Semiconductor. In addition, we create new businesses for derivative and peripheral products, which will also contribute to developing scientific technology, improving the convenience of social life and conserving the environment, and will not violate human rights. We put priority on ensuring a safe business environment. We strictly abide by applicable laws, regulations and our articles of incorporation and have established and adopted management systems such as for quality, environmental preservation, and occupational health and safety.
All HORIBA Group companies throughout the world are engaged in their respective areas of strengths in development, production, sales or service functions and strive to deliver high value-added products and services in the shortest possible time to customers all over the world.
We effectively allocate our resources in carefully selected fields in order to satisfy various needs of our customers. We thereby aim to become a global market leader in each of our businesses and product areas.

Responsibility to Shareholders and Investors
We recognize that returning profits to shareholders by consistently raising HORIBAs long-term corporate value is one of the priority objectives of management. Our shareholder return policy is to set a certain target ratio for total returns (the combination of dividend payments and share buybacks) to shareholders relative to HORIBAs consolidated net income, and consistently deliver it. In addition, we create opportunities for constructive dialogue with investors and stakeholders, regularly report operating performance, disclose important business or managerial issues fairly and promptly, and maintain transparency in management.

HORIBA Group companies maintain a timely and responsive management control system with a common information base. The managements of Group companies also share responsibility in generating profit, delivering dividend payments, establishing and managing the internal control system, and developing human resources.
 

HORIBARIANs
We are proud of the entrepreneurial spirit that led to the creation of HORIBA Group companies. We are expected to maintain this heritage and are actively encouraged to generate unique ideas and realize innovations while being conscious of each others human rights.

An open and fair business environment shall be provided, with attention to the safety and wellness, so that we can make maximum use of our talent and potential and achieve our individual goals. We are also expected to respect each other and demonstrate strength in diversity by accepting others. At the same time, for us to grow further, we are encouraged to have intercultural understanding and a global mindset.

We develop a work environment where we can grow and exert our talents to the maximum. Specifically, we will accelerate diversity management and expand the development and exchange program of our international core human resources. Our performance evaluation system is merit-based (not demerit-based), so as to reward us who make efforts in improving our business performance with a challenging spirit.  History of HORIBA 19451960s

Instagram Our Story
Twenty-five years ago, CEO of SCLogic, Mike Saldi, sat in his car in downtown Baltimore, ready to file a stack of papers to incorporate his new company.

Mike had built his career in an industry centered around manufacturing and retailing, then cutting-edge technology like barcode scanners and mobile computers. But, he came to realize that there was a gap in this industry, one that he made it his mission to solve.

Over the past two decades, our company has changed dramatically, taking on hundreds of new customers, building complex operations, and delivering modern, configurable software solutions to businesses and universities across the world.

Weve found a home at our headquarters in beautiful downtown Annapolis, Maryland. Weve created departments centered around customer success. Weve watched careers flourish, and businesses grow in exponential ways, and were just getting started. 
Our Team
We are a team of collaborative, passionate, and forward-thinking individuals. At SCLogic, we prioritize our customers each day. Gone are the days when you feel unseen by huge corporations, fighting to get your software to meet your needs.

Instead, you are welcomed with open arms by our team, who will work with you through all stages of installation, implementation, and long-term success. Nothing makes us happier than seeing your business flourish.

WE ARE COLLABORAT_
Our Core Values
1
Passion
With every service we provide, we have a team of passionate, solution-oriented people excited to take on their next challenge. In the thick of making change is where our team thrives.

2
Communication
One thing we know is that communication is key. When you work with SCLogic, you're building a relationship. We love our customers, and we hope you love us just the same!

3
Innovation
We aren't content with complacency. When it comes to our software, we want to be the best in the industry. We created Intra to solve your pain points with maximum efficiency.

4
Collaboration
We know that the best things are created when great minds come together. From inter-departmental ideas to solutions from the help of our clients and partners, we are thankful.

The brainpower here far exceeds the 65 people we have in this office. Weve created an environment where we truly care about our customers, and our team showcases that. We are truly a family, and there is no place I would rather work than right here.

Chris, out of your Morgantown location, went out of his way to get me the needed product preserving thousands of doses of the vaccine.

Testimonial For SeeSOR
We needed to build a management system for worldwide security operation that could be certified to ISO & ANSI/ASIS standards and we only had three months to get it done. With SeeSOR we structured system design and found, tracked, and remediated nonconformities. SeeSOR supported our system documentation and processes, and automated performance analysis and graphics. But best of all was ASC's 100% availability for real-time technical support and guidance - even when we called from the Middle East! Upon receiving certification, the independent Certifying Body noted SeeSOR as a strong contributor in their final report. SeeSOR was the application, and ASC the partner, we needed throughout to help us meet our goal!""



??Director of Quality (retired) for a large security company

Accolades
Seems to me that everyone is giving kudos [for winning the Protest] to the documentation - and rightly so. My thought is that the kudos should go to the process that was used to document the effort, and that's TF!, ASC's process.""

TF! enables evaluation and comparison on a line-item basis, and a feasibility analysis within a short time frame.""

I am thoroughly impressed with the capability and ease of SeeSOR.""

Our SSHO is happy with SeeSOR, training [by ASC] went well. She is amazed at how we can customize the plans.""

The underlying file documentation in all areas is what really put us over the top.""

Stellarray is helping to solve important problem in irradiation and imaging using the worlds first flat panel x-ray source and other novel radiation source platforms.In irradiation systems, we are developing compact cabinet irradiators for sterilization of biologics and other materials, conveyor systems for the sterilization of agricultural and other products, and a digital irradiator that will accelerate experimentation and deepen data sets in cellular and other radiobiology studies.

Our tomographic imaging systems will be truly portable, while still providing high quality images.  A portable 3-D mammography (digital breast tomosynthesis) system will be small enough to fit into a suitcase and reach underserved women in rural, inner city, tribal and other remote areas who currently have limited access to this new standard of care. A battlefield and emergency trauma imaging system will be compact and modular enough to provide high quality 3-D images of a range of medical conditions in an ambulance or in remote environments during the golden hour following an injury.  These systems build on a Phase II SBIR project Stellarray performed for NASA on a tomographic radiation source small and light enough to bring on space missions. 

 

Stellarray was spun out of Stellar Micro Devices (SMD) after a project for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to decontaminate biohazards with radiation.  Panel manufacturing process development was supported by the NIST Advanced Technology Program. The company has received further support from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy, as well as a seed investment from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund.  Stellarray won First Prize in the Medical Category in the 2015 NASA/Tech Briefs Create the Future Contest for its imaging system work.

All of Stellarrays radiation panels use cathode arrays to make the move from point sources, such as X-ray tubes, to our innovative panel sources. The X-ray panels use electron beams from cathode arrays fabricated on one side of the panel to strike a metal target (anode) across vacuum on the opposite side.  If all the cathodes are turned on at once, X-rays emit from the entire panel area, for a Flat Panel X-ray Source, or FPXS. In the Digitally Addressable X-ray Source, small groups of cold cathodes are addressed at specific locations on the panel to make X-ray pixels, the location of which can be moved electronically rather than by moving the source. UV radiation sources are made by hitting phosphors with electron beams.  Stellarrays sources can be made a range of sizes using processes and techniques from the flat panel display industry.

   Education and Training About Penser
Established in 1968 by Vern and Diane Parks, Penser North America was originally known as Penser International Ltd. The company was set up specifically to represent state funded employers on matters of workers' compensation. In the mid-seventies,

Penser expanded its services to include unemployment cost containment, human resources, loss control and self-insurance.

Phil Valdens, President, Penser North America, Inc.
In January of 2003, Barrett Parks and Phil Valdens purchased the company from Vern and Diane. What followed with the new principals at the helm has been an extremely successful business. Penser is dedicated to only hiring the best in the industry who strive for excellence and continued improvement.

After 40 years, what started as a new concept with modest beginnings has grown to a full-fledged force in the third party administration and human resource areas. Penser has set the standard by which other Third Party Administrators now operate.

Barrett Parks, Vice President, Penser North America, Inc.
By partnering with Penser North America, our customers benefit from a wealth of knowledge and experience unparalleled in the Northwest and beyond. Penser's commitment to excellence extends to your employees, ensuring them respect and a timely and complete response to their needs.

Our team concept of claims management extends from each of our departments to your organization, working together to produce a financially sound program.

""MELE has been a great mission-partner for many years!""
Lewis M.
NNSA
""It really has been great working with [MELE].  My wife did two years with [a large company] and hated every second of it.  They even have a Resign button in their HR portal, so its clear you are a number and not a person.  MELE was the exact opposite and [Josh Larson (VP of National Security)] has been more approachable than most people I have met in leadership positions.""

CLIENT SATISFACTION
""Burleson Consulting was excellent to work with and very professional. They assembled a top-notch team of experts to study and propose solutions to the water supply challenges at Sutter National Wildlife Refuge. The communication was excellent throughout the project. This included project staff, contracting personnel, and interested stakeholders. As a result, the project was completed on time and on budget. I would not hesitate to use or recommend Burleson Consulting in the future.""
Kevin Clancy, Project Manager  United States Bureau of Reclamation Who We Are
Founded in 2001, Burleson Consulting has grown to 32 environmental staff in our Sacramento, Monterey, Orange, and San Diego, California, area offices. We are a leading provider of environmental compliance and engineering services for federal, state, municipal, and industrial clients throughout California. Burleson provides quality environmental compliance, site assessment and remediation, and water resources services to government and private-sector clients. Our professionals have environmental experience and in-depth knowledge of the latest technologies, developments in environmental compliance, remediation, and permitting services. We are experienced with NEPA, CEQA, CERCLA, RCRA, and water quality permitting and monitoring.

Our environmental specialists work with project applicants, engineers, municipalities, and resource agencies to develop design alternatives that avoid or minimize impacts to sensitive resources. Our wetland permitting specialists have a comprehensive understanding of mitigation monitoring and permitting requirements associated with resource impacts and the implications on budget and schedule. Our experience includes protocol biological surveys, habitat mapping, wetland delineations, biological assessments, agency consultation, and public participation, including administrative records, hearings, stakeholder coordination, and public workshops. We provide construction worker training on threatened and endangered species and habitat identification. We have completed numerous environmental projects and have participated in Section 7 & 106 consultations; 1602, 404, and 401 permitting, wetland delineations, and special status species surveys.

Burleson successfully crafts feasible project design alternatives that qualify for expedited environmental review and often require fewer environmental permits through an approach that incorporates the environmental principles of avoidance and minimization and meets all technical engineering requirements. This directly benefits the project schedule and budget. We have completed multifaceted environmental documents for office complexes, power plants, surface water resources, transmission lines, and maintenance facilities.

The substantial site assessment and remediation experience of our scientists and engineers enable us to effectively solve our clients environmental contamination challenges. With expertise at preliminary assessments, site inspections, site characterization, and remedial investigations, Burleson brings a creative, cost-efficient approach to the characterization and remediation of contaminated sites. We also use site information to evaluate, identify, and implement sound remedies to support client goals. We have significant experience working at abandoned mine lands in remote areas, DOD facilities, and active industrial facilities.

& Serve
Transcons team is made up of exceptional scientists and planners with varied and extensive backgrounds. Our employees expertise, experience, integrity, and creative problem-solving have helped Transcon become a well-respected and sought-after environmental consulting company. Our leadership team is ready and able to manage client and agency expectations, identify creative solutions, and lead any project.

Christy Holmes
President
Christy is a Northern California native. While attending Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, she realized she could make a career of her love of being outside. After earning a bachelors degree in biological sciences, she held a succession of field biologist jobs, notably monitoring endangered birds and eradicating their predators on Maui, small mammal trapping throughout Northern California, shorebird mist-netting off the coast of Oregon, and years of shorebird monitoring along Californias Central Coast for state and federal agencies as well as private entities. Immediately prior to joining Transcon, she worked as a third-party (agency) on-site environmental coordinator at a long-term oil field remediation and abandonment project. In 2010, a relocation to the Bay Area and a connection through Pacific Gas and Electric Company brought her to Transcon, and she became Transcons first California-based full-time biologist. In her time at Transcon, she has worn many hats, including senior biologist, project manager, program manager, and client manager. In 2012, she became Transcons Biology Group lead, and in January 2017, she became the Pacific regional manager, two positions that redirected her to a path of management. While she will always have a love of biology, she feels like she has found her calling in supervision, mentoring, and leadership. Christy was promoted to company president in 2021.

Mike Warner
Sr. VP Business Development
Mike is the founder and past president of Transcon Environmental, which was established in 1999. He started his consulting career more than 30 years ago and, in addition to operating Transcon, he has worked with utility clients across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Much of his technical professional expertise has been devoted to siting and permitting linear infrastructure, some projects extending across multiple states for more than a thousand miles. He is skilled in complex multi-disciplinary coordination efforts and compliance strategies with local, state, and federal agencies. He has managed dozens of utility projects and provided expert witness testimony. As the president and owner of Transcon, Mike oversaw the growth of the company from 2 employees to over 250 employees, and from a few clients to hundreds of clients. He currently splits his time between Ferndale and San Francisco, California.

Jeff Davis
VP Business Development
Jeff grew up in Sandy, Utah, and was Transcons very first employee. He has a masters degree in landscape architecture and environmental planning and a bachelors degree in conservation biology: resource management. He has over 22 years of professional experience as a project manager and is a senior vice president providing market capture and client relations support. He has expanded Transcons clients and services into several regions, including the Southwest, Intermountain West, Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and East Coast. He has grown Transcon services into industry sectors, including utilities (electric and gas), renewable energy, telecommunications, water, transportation, mining, and construction. Jeff has practical and project management expertise in planning and permitting, siting and feasibility studies, National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and visual resource analysis. He has managed and worked on thousands of miles of linear projects for electrical transmission lines, pipelines, telecommunication, and renewable projects.

Jeff developed and leads a highly successful and celebrated environmental compliance program that has involved work on some of the largest and most complex transmission, renewable energy, and pipeline projects in the country. He has designed and spearheaded the use of creative and innovative technologies to facilitate communications, data collection, and management for these large, complex projects.

George Miller
VP Operations
George grew up in Denver, Colorado, and attended the University of Colorado, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental sciences and a masters degree in urban and regional planning. He has been a professional planner for more than 30 years, with experience in both the public and private sectors, and is a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. He has been involved with environmental planning, resource management, and project management on utility infrastructure for most of his career and is exceptionally qualified in linear project siting and routing, National Environmental Policy Act compliance, and mitigation planning. George has managed hundreds of miles of transmission line, telecommunication, and pipeline projects involving federal, state, and local permitting. He has served in a variety of capacities for projects involving most federal and state agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Department of Energy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state natural resources agencies, and State Historic Preservice Offices, as well as various other tribal, state, and local agencies. George has been at Transcon for over 20 years; for the past 14 years he has served as Transcons vice president of operations, overseeing the companys Human Resources, Health and Safety, Insurance, IT, and Fleet departments.

Osmer Beck
Vice President
Osmer grew up on a farm in Utah and attended Brigham Young University-Idaho, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in integrated studio art and a minor in natural resources. Osmer continued his education at Utah State University, where he earned a master's degree in landscape architecture and environmental planning. Osmer was the first full-time planner Transcon hired in Utah. He has held many roles and responsibilities, including environmental planning, GIS, visual resources, technology development, compliance inspection, reclamation monitoring, noxious weed treatment, NEPA consultation, and project management. He has worked on and managed projects in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia. He has worked on and managed projects from up-front siting through reclamation in various industries, including power utility, telecommunication, oil and gas, mining, renewable energy development, water, transportation, and government. These projects have included working and coordinating with the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and many Tribes and state agencies. In June 2018, he was promoted to Great Basin regional manager. He now serves as vice president overseeing half of the companys staff and projects and assisting with other operations.

Tim Green
Vice President
Tim began his career with Transcon in 2000, serving as an inspector on a telecommunication project between Texas and California. After the completion of the project, he took a position as a biologist with the Department of Defense in Arizona and later as an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Florida. Tim kept in touch with the leadership at Transcon, and in 2011, when a great opportunity presented itself to manage environmental inspection on a large transmission line project in Utah, he rejoined the company and headed back west. Since then, he has managed environmental permitting and compliance for several large transmission, pipeline, transportation, and water projects, where he has had the opportunity to work collaboratively with multidisciplinary teams to build large infrastructure projects as well as help grow and manage Transcon. In 2018, he was promoted to regional manager and began serving as vice president in 2021. Tim holds a bachelors degree in environmental sciences from the University of Florida (Go Gators!) and a masters degree in sustainable land management from Colorado State University. Whether it is managing a project or managing a company, Tim enjoys working with others to identify opportunities and implement solutions to achieve success.

Lindsey, Archaeologist

As a senior archaeologist and project manager with Transcon, I have the opportunity to target work I enjoy, manage all aspects of projects, and earn the satisfaction of completing quality work. Working for Transcon is never boring or slow, ever evolving, and always rewarding.

Developing and maintaining a realistic and logical Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) is critical to enabling proper program planning and execution. The Augur team is comprised of experts at the development, sustainment, and analysis of schedules as well as evaluation of 3rd party vendor schedules.

Performance Management
Whether traditional Earned Value Management (EVM), Agile performance analysis, or ad hoc implementation and tracking, Augur's team of experts and certified professionals can help baseline plans, measure performance, and make actionable recommendations.


Cost Analysis
Augurs analysts follow a rigorous cost estimating process that enables leadership to make informed decisions regarding program planning and cost savings.

 

Our process begins with a thorough understanding of the program, its technical requirements, and risks. Depending on the maturity of the program, our estimators perform a series of estimating techniques including research of analogous programs, parametric analysis, and engineering build-ups.

While our team is experienced with a variety of estimating tools, we predominately use the ACEIT software suite. Our estimates account for all phases of the lifecycle and are well documented to effectively support acquisition milestone decision-making. Thorough documentation allows for independent reproducibility of the estimates and fully encapsulates inputs, assumptions, methodologies and risks.

Our analysts will provide continued support by quantifying the impact of cost excursions and should-cost initiatives as well as providing improved external reporting and an efficient program management process.

The cost analysis services provided by Augur include:

Lifecycle Cost Estimating (LCCE)

Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCE)

Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)

Business Case Analysis (BCA)

Economic Analysis (EA)

Will-Cost / Should-Cost Analysis

Cost Estimating Relationship (CER) development

Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) analysis / Affordability Analysis

 

Schedule Analysis
Augurs schedule team ensures that all requirements, resources, and dependencies are captured appropriately, enabling efficient planning of all program activities and scope.

?

Our schedule analysts review each task for proper schedule logic, duration, and constraints. By constructing schedules that adhere to industry best practices, it is assured that the schedules are useful and capable of being used as programmatic tools.

?

A valid Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) allows leadership to track progress against a schedule baseline and evaluate schedule mitigation options in order to maintain schedule objectives. Through critical path analysis, analysts are able to inform decision makers of potential risk areas and schedule drivers. Early identification of schedule inefficiencies allows program managers to plan more effectively and allocate resources to key tasks.

Lituus Schedule Analyzer:

Augur independently developed the specialized Lituus Schedule Analyzer, a part of a suite of analytical software tools.  The Lituus Schedule Analyzer is Microsoft compatible, and is capable of efficiently and effectively assessing integrated master schedule files uploaded from separate software programs. The tool rapidly provides our analysts and clients with metrics and pertinent information regarding the quality of schedule construction in accordance with DCMA assessments, adherence to best practices as identified by the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide, and execution performance per National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) guidelines.

 

Performance Management
Augur Consulting has a team made up of experts in managing vendor performance on behalf of government program. We ensure that program baselines are executable and measurable. Augur can conduct, lead, or train the government on how to perform a proper baseline event. This process can be implemented on Agile projects, medium sized efforts, and large investments requiring EVM. Augur can perform baseline events, audits, surveillance, and analysis/management of vendor performance. We often conduct training events to improve the government's ability to conduct a baseline event such as IBRs. Augur has no OCIs and can participate in source selection, contract negotiations, and other related programmatic support. 

 

Augur's leadership is comprised of Certified Earned Value Professionals (EVP), and our staff has a variety of traditional EVM experience, agile performance management, and other ad hoc methods to evaluate vendor performance and ensure tax dollars are executed efficiently


Data Analytics & Visualization
In order for program leadership to make informed decisions, data must be in a form that is meaningful and understandable. Key takeaways are made possible through data analysis and visualization tools including the use of PowerBI, Tableau, R, JACS, PO$T, CO$TAT, and LITUUS.  Data analysis is the fundamental underpinning that enables program managers to make informed decisions surrounding cost, schedule, vendor performance and other ad-hoc decision support.

ABOUT
WOODWAY
WOODWAY is a global organization 
built on the efforts and commitment 
of dedicated professionals. 
Our purpose is to manufacture 
products and provide services that 
exceed our customers expectations 
through continuous improvements in 
quality and design. 
Our focus is on building lasting 
customer relationships that will 
endure For The Long Run.
THE WOODWAY NAME
In 1975, WOODWAY GMBH was founded in Weil am Rhein, Germany. The name 
WOODWAY is derived from the German Waldweg (Wald = Wood and Weg = Way) 
 the feel of running on a soft pine needle covered path in the forest.
OUT OF THIS WORLD
WOODWAY was selected to produce the physical treadmill base used in the COLBERT 
(T2), which is a NASA project implemented to place a treadmill system on the International 
Space Station. WOODWAYs patented treadmill design meets the unique requirements 
of the space station as well as the health needs of the astronauts.
3
HEALING ONE STEP AT A TIME
WOODWAYs highly specialized line of medical treadmills have been the preferred choice 
of medical specialists for decades, specifically engineered for physical therapy, cardiology 
rehabilitation, bariatric, and any other rehabilitation application.
THE ORIGINAL NON-MOTORIZED TREADMILL
Since 2009, the CURVE treadmill has been a staple in performance facilities world-wide 
for training athletes of various skill levels. From walkers to elite athletes, the CURVE allows 
users to run at any pace while burning up to 30% more calories using zero electricity.
4
THE WOODWAY DIFFERENCE
THERE ARE CONVENTIONAL TREADMILLS, AND THEN THERE IS WOODWAY.
WOODWAY treadmills feature revolutionary technology that provides users with an experience unlike any other. WOODWAY engineers 
set out to develop a safe and comfortable running surface for users that reduce shock on the body, but also reduces the friction and wear 
associated with the conventional conveyor belt style. The system is so durable it runs reliably year after year, saving more on energy costs 
than any other treadmill and yet, is so comfortable you can even on it barefoot.
NO-SLIP
DRIVE PULLEYS & BELT
Designed to provide accurate speed, the 
toothed belt and drive, together with numerous 
glide rollers, assure the belt will not stretch or 
slip - no need to adjust or tension, ensuring 
accurate speed readout with every workout.
LOW FRICTION BALL BEARING 
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Every treadmill features two bearing rails that 
allow the running surface to glide seamlessly 
along the frame, nearly eliminating friction 
and the resulting wear which leads to a longer 
life and significant electrical savings. 
SHOCK REDUCING 
SLAT BELT RUNNING SURFACE
Comprised of numerous individual shockabsorbing slats that have been scientifically 
proven to reduce harmful shock to joints, 
muscles, and connective tissue. The running 
surface can absorb more than 150,000 miles 
of usage without a single belt change.
5
6
EXPERIENCE THE BEST
Many of the features that make WOODWAY treadmills more comfortable also make 
them more durable.
Unlike most conventional treadmills you see with a conveyor belt style running surface 
made from standard thin PVC, nylon, and cotton, WOODWAY treadmills feature a 
unique running surface of vulcanized rubber. This material allows our running surface to 
last for more than 150,000 miles, roughly ten times longer than the belt of an average 
treadmill.
Each treadmill is designed to create significantly less friction and wear, resulting in a belt 
that will never need tracking adjustments and you will never have to wax or flip a deck 
because there isnt one. These efficiencies can translate into $300 - $800 in electrical costs, 
maintenance, or replacement parts, for each year, per treadmill, in a high use environment. 
* Study conducted by Major University Recreational Department
7
FOR THE LONG RUN
Fully equipped with a galvanized steel frame capable of supporting up to 800 lbs, WOODWAY treadmills are 
built to last.
Only WOODWAY offers a true zero start and doesnt necessitate a heavy-duty motor to counter the friction 
problem created by the inefficient design of conventional treadmills.
In addition to less wear and tear on components, WOODWAYs unique design is also more efficient, requiring 
about 50% less electricity to operate. The combination of maintenance and electrical savings result in a lower 
Total Cost of Ownership with less downtime in comparison with conventional treadmills. WOODWAYs are 
the ideal cardio solution For The Long Run.

Having been involved in both fitness and athletics over the 
past 20 years, I have seen many different treadmills and heard 
many different claims, but WOODWAY actually walks the 
talk when it comes to providing a top-of-the line product.
Here, at the NSCA Performance Center, we have a variety of 
WOODWAY models to suit our needs.
The PRO XL, FORCE, AND DESMO (4FRONT) treadmills 
give us several different options to suit the variety of athletes 
we train from tactical officers to Division 1 college athletes.
I highly recommend WOODWAY treadmills to anyone looking 
for an asset with training athletes.

The Polar View
The Wattbike Polar View is a unique analysis tool which can 
help you master the perfect pedalling technique.
Simply put, the Polar View is a graphical representation of your 
pedalling technique. It shows the balance between your left 
and right leg, the force you apply to the pedals and where 
exactly you apply this force within the pedal stroke.
Beginner
Intermediate
Elite Cyclist
The cyclist is only using the 
muscles on the front of the 
thigh and is stomping on 
the pedals. This loses all 
momentum between the 
left and right leg and wastes 
energy.
TIP
Try adjusting your cadence 
(RPM). Aim to pedal between 
85 and 100 RPM.
The cyclist retains some 
momentum and is starting 
to use the muscles on the 
back of the thigh and calf.
TIP
Imagine scraping mud off the 
sole of your show to engage 
the muscles on the back of 
the leg.
The cyclist has an excellent 
technique with very little 
loss of momentum between 
left and right leg, a good 
even distribution of power 
throughout the pedal stroke 
and excellent balance 
between left and right leg.

Wyant Data Systems has delivered high-quality, cost effective Information Technology (IT) services to clients since 1995.


The company was founded by Rick Wyant and Scott Lee on the premise that a small group of tightly-knit, highly-skilled professionals can deliver a more cost-effictive product -- the first time, every time. That idea remains intrinsic to the success of our business.


We accomplish that vision by first understanding the customer's requirements. We then create a solution that brings exactly the ""Right Resource at the Right Time"" to meeting those requirements. This approach provides the customer with the ""Best Value"" in an IT Solution.

Our Services
Much of our success has been the result of our reputation, which comes from the way we partner with clients. While it is true that the IT landscape is full of 'magic boxes,' we still base our business on one-on-one, person-to-person interaction, always the human element. Why? Because we believe a creative human mind is still the finest piece of high-technology yet developed. We don't just throw high-tech at a problem. Creative thinking is what we throw at a problem; it is what we do best.

We achieve customer satisfaction by first partnering with our customer to fully understand their requirement. Once we understand, we then create a solution that brings exactly the 'Right Resource at the Right Time' to meeting those requirements. Our approach provides the customer with a solution that meets their needs and is the 'Best Value' in an IT solution.

Our designers also must have strong Networking, Electrical, General construction, and Specialty systems back grounds, this additional experience allows our team to be not only tuned into your physical layer and standards based distribution needs but how they impact the overall project. This type of design approach has become considerably more important with the converged and collapsed environment in which our businesss all work. With the common use of IP based systems growing well beyond our data networks into all systems within our buildings we have been able to design in the proper elements to save our customers the cost and headache of how these systems interconnect and potentially conflict.

Our approach is to understand our customers goal with the overall integration into other systems to ensure we offer or support the appropriate solution.

We provide precise environmental conditioning and control for critical equipment spaces such as Data Centers, IDF's, POP locations ECT... any location which requires critical control of the environment. Damage to network systems occurs when the temperature within the area is too high or too low; additionally data integrity and operating reliability can be compromised. Controlling the relative humidity of such areas is just as important as regulating their temperature. Too much humidity can corrode contacts and components, not enough humidity causes damaging static electricity.

It is true that Precision air conditioning systems cost more to purchase and install than the environmental cooling units. But the overall cost of the installation is considerably less when you take into account the hidden cost of operation and reliability related to environmental air systems

Distribution of all Data Center systems is critical in nature and need to be properly supported. We provide the following solutions and multiple products within each.

Cherokee Federal's team of companies offer a unique approach to humanitarian solutions through a unifying concept called Team Hope.

Team Hope is a group of uniquely capable and passionate professionals focused on provided specialized staffing resources, emergency services and the critical assets and systems needed to deliver culturally compassionate care to vulnerable populations. We have partnered with the federal government in response to dozens of urgent missions around the globe. Our most recent experience includes caring for and reuniting children from the Northern Triangle with parents or sponsors and supporting Afghan refugees whove fled their home country to seek safety in the U.S.

100% of our profits go to serve citizens of the Cherokee Nation, many who are still impacted by multi-generational impacts of cultural uprooting, a nearly impossible journey filled with stories of loss, resiliency and triumph. 

 

This a full circle moment for us, a population of resettlement survivors and their descendants. Our work allows us to give hope to vulnerable people in need of compassionate and culturally appropriate care. We see this as an opportunity to alter the course of history by creating a more hopeful future for those we serve and generations to follow.

The Power of Hope
Around the world, many people are victims of conflict and crisis. They endure wars, famine, natural disasters, poverty and violence. Many must flee their countries, leaving behind friends, family and all theyve ever known. With little clue of what may happen to them, but knowing their lives likely depend on finding a new home. The trauma they experience can lead to hopelessness  a sense there is little expectation their situation will get better in the future. At Team Hope, what can we do to support them? Beyond the basics of providing food, shelter and essential needs, the common mission we are committed to is giving everyone we serve hope for a better future.

 

The impact of our work is significant and exponential. The opportunity to be a small part of their journey and offer a hopeful vision for their next chapter is what drives us every day.

Healing Children in Crisis

Hear from David Danwing, Cherokee Federals Senior Director of Case Management, about the healing powers of Trauma Informed Care in shelter environments.


Emergency Intake Site  Pomona, CA
Cherokee Nation Management & Consulting was the prime contractor to lead the operations of an emergency intake site in Pomona, CA with the capacity to support 2,500 unaccompanied children. CNMC was responsible for the care, safety and welfare of all children on site and helped reunify more than 8,500 children with their sponsored-families.

 

At the mid-point of mission, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra toured the shelter, and remarked we consider this a model. It is not easy to stand something up like this quickly, and do it right, but I think you can see that this is a place where kids can be healthy and safe.

When Seconds Matter: Deepwater Horizon Spill Recovery
Within 36 hours of receiving notice to pursue work addressing the Deepwater Horizon spill, Cherokee responded. Across the Gulf of Mexico, Cherokee rapidly dispatched 75 safety auditors and observers. Our well-trained staff had OSHA 40-hour Hazwoper and HAZMAT certifications, ensuring avoidance of workplace hazards during the long effort to mitigate the environmental impact of a 4.9-million-barrel oil spill.

The technical support team provided critical public assistance operations and complete debris removal, while our civil and structural engineering support team restored community infrastructure. Our municipal cost accounting provided important oversight, and together with our architectural and construction review, ensured the responsible standards Cherokee adheres to on all contracts were set in stone.

 

Reliable from Start to Finish: Five Years of 100% Supplier Performance
Cherokee Federals team of engineering and manufacturing companies has a long history of providing superior service on long-running programs with difficult technical requirements. For this five-year defense contract, Cherokee produced interconnect wire assemblies, instrument panels and other limited source details for military aircraft. Cherokee maintained a supplier performance rating of 100%, on both quality and delivery, for the duration of the program. Through seamless integration and constant communication, our quality, manufacturing, testing, engineering and product launch teams proactively identified and mitigated risks. The contract was a build-to-print requirement, with approximately 500 engineering changes from the defense firm on the products Cherokee manufactured.

 

Consistent Quality at Any Scale
When demand surges, Cherokee scales whether its establishing call centers and support desks or manufacturing products that power life-saving equipment, like tactical quiet generators (TQGs). During a 10-year contract to manufacture TQGs for a defense contractor, Cherokee maintained a >99% on-time delivery and quality rating. Continuous improvement that utilized Kaizen, 5S, and other lean tools gave Cherokee the flexibility to scale rapidly. Surge demand from our customers increased monthly deliveries of TQGs as much as 25% with very little notice, and without cutting corners. To anticipate such demand, Cherokee maintained quality and on-time delivery through a production cell concept. This concept minimized wasted motion, improved product flow and resolved product issues. Production cells demonstrably improved the overall efficiency of TQG build and test times  year after year.

Multi-Cloud
Multi-cloud strategy allows companies to select different cloud services from different providers because some are better for certain tasks than others.

Assessments
While making the switch to the cloud, you need to evaluate your current environment and address several readiness issues to ensure a smooth and effective transition to the cloud. Sterlings cloud assessments include:

 

Cloud agnostic, vendor aware methodology that avoids complexity upfront and packages the payload that could go to cloud
Consistently coordinated and articulated with enterprise architecture and business stakeholders
Application, infrastructure, and network analysis
Target platform mapping
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return On Investment (ROI) analysis
Digital Transformation
Many organizations are stuck in an endless loop of doing digital things, an illusion of being digital things, an illusion of  being digital rather than making changes to business, operations, and customer models.

Cloud Solutions
One of the greatest benefits of cloud computing is its flexibility. For example, if you are running out of storage, your public cloud solution can automatically scale up for you so that your operations will continue seamlessly. Sterlings approach to cloud solutions is cloud agnostic and will provide the required consistent and standard designs, and optimized cost-effective solutions that are right for you.

The additional choice of multiple cloud environments gives you flexibility and helps avoid vendor lock-in
Outages happen. Sometimes it is due to a disaster or can be due to other things like human error. Having multiple cloud environments ensures that you always have compute resources and data storage available so you can avoid downtime
Many multi-cloud environments can help enterprises achieve their goals for governance, risk management, and compliance regulations

Effectively understanding the correlation between distribution and logistics is critical to a company's bottom line. In general, logistics refers to the distribution process within the company whereas the supply chain includes multiple companies such as suppliers, manufacturers, and the retailers.

Hair and Rapid/Instant Oral Testing
Employers can create a safer workplace by using oral/urine instant fluid testing as an alternative to lab-based urine testing. Our rapid/instant testing products are easy to use and can be used for testing at the employment site or in the privacy of your home. This flexibility provides options that can suit most testing situations. Instant drug testing results eliminate the logistics and reporting delays that may occur with laboratory-based drug testing. Oral Fluid Testing provides an option for detecting recent usage. Results are instant or results may be sent to a laboratory for confirmation when non-negative. Sample collection is non- invasive and requires no special facilities, as oral fluid samples are taken directly from the mouth. Oral fluid samples are difficult to adulterate or substitute.

Hair and Instant Urine and Oral testing have some advantages over traditional, urine-based drug testing programs. These include: 

Reduced opportunity for donor adulteration, substitution, or dilution
Collections are safe & simple 
No shipping of bodily fluids
Eased burden of observed collections
Testing for both long-term lifestyle choices & recent usage
Accurates collector will perform an initial screen using an instant test device. Once complete, the collector will allow the device to process, and after a short period, the initial results will be read. Specimens that pass the initial screening test will be recorded as Negative and reported the same day! A very small percentage of initial instant urine drug test will be inconclusive and require further testing. The collector will complete a a chain-of-custody form in the presence of the donor collector, then will package the specimen for shipment to our SAMHSA (DHHS) certified laboratory partner for confirmatory testing utilizing Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) for confirmation testing. All laboratory-confirmed drug test results are first reported to a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to verify the results before reporting them to an employer.

Oral Testing Panels:

Oral Fluid 6 Panel
Oral Fluid 10 Panel
Hair Testing
Hair Testing provides quantifiable results over a 90-day timeframe. Sample collection requires no special facilities and is non-invasive, Hair samples are cut with scissors close to the scalp. We need a bunch of hair about the size of the dime in diameter. Hair samples cannot be substituted or diluted and are generally difficult to adulterate.

Hair testing reduces collection times (no shy bladder) and eliminates observed collection challenges (availability of bathrooms/same sex collectors).
Accurate and our partner laboratory offers the highest level of scientific credentials including industry leading turnaround time (1-3 business days).

We offer the following Hair Testing Panels:

Hair 5 Panel  
Hair 5 Panel plus Extended Opiates
Hair 7 Panel
Hair 13 Panel
Hair 17 Panel
EtG Panel
USCG Testing
Employers regulated by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) are required under Homeland Security regulations to maintain a drug and alcohol testing program to promote a drug-free and safe work environment for the safe passage of embarked passengers and for carriage of cargo on U.S. waterways. The marine employer must develop a program that serves as a strong deterrent to the illegal use of controlled substances by covered crewmembers, and that promotes a safe, drug-free workplace.

Those applying for a Captains license or other merchant mariner credentials need the initial drug test and periodic drug testing every two years. Accurate follows all requirements and has been a trusted USCG testing partner with a thorough understanding of these requirements.

Call us for testing anywhere in the U.S.!

Court-ordered Testing
Accurate assists our clients with maintaining 100% compliance with court-ordered drug and/or alcohol testing. These situations can range from child custody cases where parents want custody of their child, pre-trial drug test to prove the individual is not on drugs, a DUI or DWI case or probation. Accurate understands the criminal justice system testing requirements. Our drug and alcohol testing options are designed specifically for your program. We can setup individual random selection profiles utilizing an interactive voice response (IVR) system for random selections which allows testing as frequently as required. We also offer additional services based on your unique requirements.

Personal Drug Testing
We offer rapid instant test results which typically provide results within 5 to 15 minutes. You may also prefer the standard laboratory-based urine drug test. Results are received typically within 24-48 hours. We can perform the instant test or provide instructions to allow you to perform testing in the privacy of your home. These tests are oftentimes used to self-test, test a family member, test prior to taking a test for a future employer or simply prove to a loved one that you are free of drug or alcohol use.

ETG Testing
EtG Urine Drug Testing
The presence of EtG in urine is an indicator that ethanol was ingested. It can be detected in urine for up to 80 hours after ingestion. This type of test has become very popular for zero-tolerance and abstinence programs.

EtG Alcohol Hair Test
EtG alcohol hair testing generally is an indicator of a behavioral issue, or pattern of use rather than current impairment. It measures average alcohol consumption over a period of approximately three months to provide information on the level of alcohol use during that time period. The test measures the amount of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in the hair  a trace metabolite of ethanol and a direct alcohol biomarker. This type of hair testing is suitable for:

Monitoring alcohol abstinence for probation programs
Court-ordered cases
Child custody cases
Drug court cases
DWI cases
Other situations where the person is prohibited from consuming any alcohol
Breath Alcohol Testing
Employer workplace testing most commonly utilizes breath alcohol testing to determine current impairment. Heres how this test works. When alcohol is ingested and reaches your stomach it is absorbed into your blood and carried throughout your body, including your lungs. Alcohol is eventually exhaled through the breath. Ultimately, this test measures how much alcohol is in a persons breath, therefore indirectly measuring how much alcohol is in a persons blood, known as their blood alcohol content or blood alcohol concentration (BAC). These tests are performed by our certified and trained breath alcohol technicians (BAT) using an Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device approved by NHTSA.

Breath alcohol tests are suitable for:

Personal uses
Legal uses (probation, child custody, etc.)
Employers
DOT-regulated businesses and individuals
DOT-regulated employers must use breath alcohol testing for compliance with DOT alcohol testing requirements.

Change Management
G2 provides formal change management processes with customizable approval workflows and automated email notifications. All changes can be managed from a single screen.

To more efficiently manage change, iconography is used to indicate the type of change being made on each project and whether an approval action is required by the user.



Schedule Management
G2 allows each organization to define a custom Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to organize and manage their work. Common to all organizations is that the lowest level of each WBS represents projects that are decomposed into tasks, milestones, and related metrics.

G2 summarizes a projects tasks in an interactive Gantt view that allows users to easily view and filter work based on progress and active changes.

Additionally, the details of each task are presented in a way that highlights the latest status, work progress, and deltas between the baseline and forecast milestone dates. From within this view, baseline changes as well as status updates can be initiated.


Financial Management
G2 manages financials for each organization performing work on a project and is therefore able to summarize financials at any higher level of the WBS.

Formal change management processes provide organizations with a structured, accountable, and transparent way to allocate new funding, move funding between projects, communicate spending plans, estimate future year budget needs, collect actual costs, and reconcile with external systems. Shown below is a compact financial chart that concisely identifies the various types of funding, costs, and commitments that are managed within G2.


Process
G2 was developed using an agile framework known as SAFe. This framework provides enterprises with a set of principles and practices For achieving business agility using Lean, Agile, and DevOps.

Robotics Process Automation (RPA) is one of the most operationally effective areas of information technology innovation today. Most commonly it represents the development and distribution of autonomous software robots (bots) which make use of existing human software interfaces (rather than machine-based interfaces) to automate routine and repetitive business processes so that more expensive human labor can be avoided and/or employed in areas that are not amiable for automation. The area is expanding as additional new industries and enterprises begin to develop and deploy such bots and as the domain that is amiable for automation expands.

Even more exciting is the application of artificial intelligence (iRPA), particularly in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing, into automation. This can range from the relatively simple - where bots are developed to autonomously fetch and condense information from multiple sources into a single display that is conducive to human decision making - to the complex, where bots are trained to evaluate data and act autonomously.

RiVidium has an active research program focused on developing and implementing iRPA into Human Capital Management applications.

TripleCyber is a new, patented cyber-communication technology that validates inbound cyber-communications before they arrive at your computer  and thwarts cyber-attacks.

Shared Services is a business model for delivery of common back office administrative services such as human resources (HR) and common mission-support services in which customer organizations receive services from experienced third party providers with high capacity platforms who can serve multiple customers more cost-effectively than individual customers can serve themselves.

RiVidium has developed and enhanced its Shared Services model for the delivery of human resources operations to federal clients. RiVidium maintains a cadre of staffing specialists, classification specialists, and personnel processors that can perform services for multiple federal agencies simultaneously and remotely. For example, one Classifier may work on classification actions for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense.

The primary advantage of a shared services concept is greater efficiency and more effective use of resources; therefore, cost savings. Additionally, personnel providing the services gain training and experience, providing better service to all customers. Global experience with shared services has indicated a typical cost savings of 25% to 40% and better service over other models. Additionally, the expansion of IT cloud services and remote technology supports continued expansion of the shared services concept.

RiVidiums has partnered with T&W to deliver Inventory Control Solution and perform full warehouse inventory management utilizing a combination of technologies including RFID tags, RFID readers, barcodes, sensors, Wi-Fi networks, and the Internet. Additionally, the software provides the capability to categorize each inventory item, which is easily and quickly set up to meet the clients requirements. Our solution provides complete inventory tracking and control from receipt at the warehouse to client receipt. This includes:

Reliable, collaborative plans
Because UGIES is an energy marketer that owns and operates our own natural gas storage and delivery assets, our natural gas plans are highly reliable both financially and physically.

Equally important, our focus on providing highly personalized service helps us structure plans tailored to your key demands. Well help you develop a purchasing solution for your short- or long-term needs  one with no billing issues, supply problems, or surprises.

Fixed Price
Enjoy price certainty for periods ranging from several months to several years. Locking into the certainty of a fixed price plan can help you more easily manage your energy budget. A simple fixed price contract can reduce or even eliminate price volatility and market risk, ensuring your natural gas bill will be consistent and predictable.

Market Price
Our market-based price plans allow you to take advantage of variable market conditions that can often provide significant energy savings. With the guidance of our experienced and knowledgeable sales force, your business can manage market risk while capturing the rewards of low-cost supply.

NYMEX Triggers
To help control commodity costs, UGIES can structure a plan based on predetermined NYMEX triggers that will help you meet your cost targets and protect your bottom line.

Cost Components
While your natural gas supply price is based on several cost components, the key drivers are the cost of the gas itself and the location to which it is being delivered. The development of natural gas from the Marcellus shale has greatly impacted the cost of gas supplied throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region. UGIES can help you manage this new supply scenario in a way that best supports your business.

Commodity Price
The commodity portion of your natural gas supply price is the price of the natural gas. This cost component is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and is often referred to as the NYMEX. All UGIES products give you the flexibility to lock NYMEX in various amounts at any time throughout your contract.

Basis Price
The basis portion of your natural gas supply price is the price of transporting and delivering your natural gas to a specific customer location. This cost component is highly sensitive to physical system constraints and supply network limitations. UGIES products provide added flexibility to lock some or all of your basis cost throughout the life of your contract.

Supported by powerful assets
UGI Energy Services doesnt just buy and sell natural gas in the market place  we own key natural gas gathering and storage assets. Facilities are strategically located and are feed into the local utility and interstate pipeline systems. By optimizing the use of our own natural gas assets well keep your facility reliably supplied with natural gas.

UGI Energy Services offers renewable options for both natural gas and electricity products.

Simple plans that control costs
Deregulation has created new ways to cut electricity costs. But its also made managing electricity contracts more complicated, with savings that are hard to measure. A UGIES electricity plan offers a much simpler alternative  we can help you manage your electricity expenses more proactively with two smart, straightforward options*:

Fixed Pricing Option
UGIES provides electric power at a preset price for a specific period of time  perfect for budget-conscious customers that want fixed-pricing predictability.

Indexed Pricing Option
UGIES offers power at a rate indexed to the hourly PJM Locational Marginal Price (LMP)  an attractive option for users who can take advantage of market pricing and are willing to accept some level of price risk. The indexed price fluctuates constantly with market conditions.

*Pricing for both options includes capacity, energy, line losses, transmission charges, and support services.

Supported by powerful assets
Unlike electricity marketers that only buy and sell electricity in the marketplace, UGIES owns key generation assets. Facilities are strategically located in northeastern PA and are part of the PJM Power Pool.

UGI Energy Services is committed to investing in renewable energy options as we strive for a cleaner, greener future. Our current portfolio of renewables includes renewable natural gas (RNG), solar power, and landfill gas to power options. Our green energy experts can help your organization to navigate the complicated world of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs and SRECs), tax credits and incentives, Carbon Offsets, and Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs).

Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)
RNG has been produced for several decades, but has recently gained more visibility as a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuels.  RNG is pipeline-quality gas that is fully interchangeable with conventional natural gas and can be converted to compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG).

RNG is a biogas, meaning that it is produced from organic matter such as manure and food waste that have been processed to purity standards. The production of RNG requires the removal of impurities such as Carbon Dioxide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Oxygen, Nitrogen and other gasses to meet strict pipeline and utility quality standards.

Demand for RNG is growing worldwide thanks to an increased awareness in environmental concerns and an interest in clean energy alternatives. RNG is a low-carbon alternative to its fossil fuel counterpart. The capture and utilization of fugitive methane emissions from sources such as landfills, manure lagoons, and wastewater treatment mean a reduction in the emission of these gasses into the atmosphere.

UGI Energy Services offers RNG options through GHI Energy. GHI offers renewable natural gas to fleet operators. UGIES and GHI experts help customers navigate the natural gas and carbon credit markets, maximizing fleet value and achieving renewable energy goals.

By powering fleets with clean RNG, customers can experience less price volatility, lower their tax rates, and take advantage of tax credits and other incentives. And by boosting their sustainability, customers can boost their brand image as well, showing their companys concern for the environment and the community.

For more information about RNG options offered through GHI, visit their website.

Photovoltaic Solar Facilities
By utilizing the power of the sun, Photovoltaic Solar Facilities can create green power for their own use or to sell into the power grid system. This means that your organization can reduce the amount of electricity you purchase from the electric utility, and can sometimes even make some money by selling excess power back into the system. Solar-generated electricity qualifies for Renewable Energy Credits, or RECs, specifically SRECs.

UGI Energy Services has a track record of success with solar projects, both at our own facilities, and at our customers sites. UGIES owns and operates facilities with 13.5 megawatts of solar-powered generation capacity. These facilities include solar farms at our Temple LNG site and at our Steelton Propane Air & LNG facility.

Weve also assisted customers with numerous solar projects in various industries including industrial, food production, and education.

Landfill Gas to Power Projects
A natural bi-product of the decomposition of organic materials in landfills is a mixture of gases known as landfill gas. Landfill gas is composed of several gases, about 50% of which is methane, the primary component of natural gas.

A landfill gas to power operation prevents that gas from escaping into the air, and instead recovers the methane gas from these landfills.  The process then uses that recovered gas to produce electricity.  Not only does this process remove these greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere, but it also produces electric power from a bi-product that would otherwise be wasted.

Propane and Liquid Fuel Oil
UGI Energy Services, LLC (UGIES) owns and operates six strategically-located liquid propane gas (LPG) Air Plants. UGIES engages in the transportation, storage, terminalling, and marketing of LPG, including throughput storage solutions and peaking services.

Our Propane supply is used to serve our wholesale propane customers and to provide peaking services through the production of propane air. UGIES strategically purchases LPG to be able to offer competitive pricing for summer and winter propane supply to wholesale customers. UGIES also provides full service logistical support and transportation including two fully-supported rail terminals.

liquid propane gas

In addition to rolling storage, UGIES offers traditional tank storage capacity for through-putting at our rail terminal facilities and trucking-only facilities. This provides a viable alternative to wholesale propane customers who have limited storage. Our dedicated Liquid Fuels team offers superior sales and service with special attention to detail and customer satisfaction. Please see below for more details about each of our Propane Air Plants.

Fuel Oil Supply & Delivery
liquid propane gas tanks

Another service offered by UGIES is supply and delivery of a variety of fuel oil productsranging from Off Road Diesel to Ultra Low Sulphur Heating Oil. This service is available to existing and potential customers requiring fuel oil products, but is also a service we can offer to our interruptible natural gas customers who find themselves without gas on some of the coldest days of the year.

THERMAL AND FAST NEUTRON RADIOGRAPHY
Thermal Neutron Radiography 
Fast Neutron Radiography 
Thermal neutron radiography is used to inspect the internal features of an object.  Neutrons interact with the nucleus of materials and have strong interaction with organic materials such as carbon and hydrogen. Lead and steel have comparatively weak interactions with the neutrons, so neutron radiography is excellent for imaging organic material sealed inside of a metal casing.
Fast neutron radiography has the same benefits of inspecting internal features of parts as thermal neutron radiography, however fast neutrons have a much higher penetration depth than thermal neutrons. For parts containing hydrogenous materials with thicknesses greater than 2"", thermal neutrons will have scattered too much to make a useful image. Starfire has developed a novel image intensifier that is sensitive to fast neutrons while thermal neutrons have little to no impact on the image.

SummitET defines strategic communications as a convergence  or fusion  of the disciplines of risk and crisis communication, internal communications, reputation management, social and digital media, community education and relations and media relations. Strategic communication incorporates the Who, What, When, Why, and How into all categories of stakeholder communication, especially during risk and crisis communication events.

Organizations should periodically assess their communications holistically and create an integrated, multidisciplinary approach that furthers their organizational communication goals. In addition, organizations need well-planned strategies for risk and crisis communication, internal communication, digital and social media, community relations and education, and media relations practice. Well-planned communication strategies can minimize missed opportunities while increasing organizations abilities to reach their communication goals.

Cybersecurity Preparedness is a system intended to reduce risk from a cyber-attack that includes the development of cyber-security policies and procedures, compliance tools, information sharing pathways, training, and exercises.

Today, cybersecurity preparedness is a top concern of most businesses and government agencies, which have become greatly reliant on modern technology out of competitive necessity or the need for greater connectivity. With this connectivity comes increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Sophisticated cyber threat actors and nation-states target and exploit vulnerabilities to steal information and assets or to disrupt, destroy, or extort through the denial of services, to include the threat of non-delivery of essential services.

As a result, we understand the requirements of both business and government agencies to adjust cyber-security business plans, policies, and procedures to stay ahead of the threat and/or react to new regulations.

Tailored Preparedness Solutions
Our team of experts stand ready to prepare clients against cyber-attacks using these tailored products and services:

Support development of tailored policies and procedures to reduce risk
Development of threat information sharing pathways
Provision of training and education
Exercises designed to test compliance

Industry Experts
Our teams collective corporate experience includes, but is not limited to:

TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS
Information System Breech or Failure  Continuity of Operations

Protective/Sensitive Information Breech

Business plans typically focus on production, forecasts, meeting and exceeding client expectations and growth. Yet, how does a business continue vital operations in the face of disaster and adversity? How is forward momentum maintained along with stockholder and client/customer confidence? Only through an effective business continuity program sustained by training and exercises are business entities able to weather not only the proverbial, but literal storm.

According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in 2018 (as of July 9) there have been 6 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States. Trends the agency has studied since 1980 indicate that climate-related disasters are on the rise [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters (2018). Business continuity is tantamount to risk management, which in turn ultimately saves money while allowing for continued operations during times of crisis.

This has involved adding new chilling capacity, a new Gerber material cutting machine, and new molds capable of providing both heating and chilling during the shell molding process.

ADVANCED MATERIALS 

We are one of the pioneers of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) advancements. New composite materials produce next generation helmets that are significantly lighter than current in-use combat helmets while providing increased ballistic and impact protection. Our armor and helmet systems engineers have evaluated and experimented with a vast array of materials and material combinationsincluding new materials, various aramids and weaves, and hybrid combinations of materialsto produce armor and helmets with superior performance and comfort.

Galvion has significant experience with all UHMWPE materials that provide excellent high velocity fragmentation protection, as well as superior 9mm RTP, compression, and impact resistance, with minimal to no change in ballistic performance at extreme temperatures. We have delivered on important U.S. military and international contracts for products that use advanced UHMWPE products, and we continue to invest in R&D, expand our materials focus and we work extensively with various UHMWPE suppliers engineering teams to establish and master the manufacturing nuances for each material put to use in our Batlskin helmets. Whether soldiers are wearing our helmet in the Arctic or at the equator, the performance and protection will be consistent.

SOLDIER POWER
FORWARD-THINKING SOLUTIONS FOR THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD

The weight and complexity of powering soldiers on the modern battlefield is something that we think about a lot at Galvion. In order to increase situational awareness, operators today are part of a mobile network of users and platforms  radios, NVGs, GPS, smart phones, laptops, drones  and although these devices have become more efficient, there are a greater number of them required during demanding operations. Along with that comes the associated challenge of powering all of these devices with multiple and numerous batteries, across long distances and for extended durations. Our Nerv Centr power supply and management suite of products addresses the increasing need to store, deliver, harvest and share power in order to significantly reduce the physical weight that operators face on the wired battlefront.


Our portfolio of power products enables users to treat power as a combat supply that can be found, harvested, stored, and used flexibly at the very lowest level. Taking a cue from lessons learned in managing ammunition and water at the individual or squad level, our products enable operators to do the same with power. This energy efficiency at the individual level not only ensures power is available when it is needed; it also has major impact on the energy consumption at the mission level, resulting in reduced logistics and lower costs. Nerv Centr products are battlefield proven, reducing weight and equipment volume at the same time as increasing energy redundancy.

HIGH-TECH DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING

Our Marlborough facility is home to an accomplished hardware, software and process engineering team who work closely with manufacturing and electrical assembly teams to deliver products that are tested and certified to the highest possible military and civilian standards. Our constant innovation and advances mean software updates can be delivered in the field, increasing safety and delivering additional capabilities in real-time.

Our power management solutions include a variety of products such as slim lithium batteries, power managers and intelligent battery charging systems. The slim lithium-ion units can store, deliver and harvest power, lessening the weight burden by eliminating excess cabling and the need for spare batteries, while the power managers and battery chargers are designed to draw from any source to power a variety of equipment and recharge batteries simultaneously.


NERV CENTR SYSTEMS PROVIDE DYNAMIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE BATTLEFIELD
DYNAMIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT

Our solutions work independently to get the job done, or in tandem for extreme power needs. The SoloPack energy module is a super high density unit that is the same size and weight as a 30 round magazine, and can provide enough energy for a 12-hour mission for a high tech user. The Squad Power Manager (SPM) and Individual Power Manager (IPM) are compact, rugged power management solutions with intelligent software that allows the users at the squad and individual level to power a variety of equipment and recharge batteries with no reprogramming required. Our endlessly customizable Mission Adaptive Charging Station (MAX-8) can charge multiple batteries through custom-made adapters suited to the mission, while automatically evaluating the power source and adjusting charge rates to maximize power and minimize charge time. We have created specific kits for the U.S. Marine Corps, Air National Guard, and other international operators when they need advanced power management capabilities, no matter the environment, duration or mission size.

R&D
Since our founding in 2001, we have consistently expanded our competencies, developed new products and moved into new markets through forward-thinking acquisitions, investment in our people, our facilities and our equipment, and by imagining what others have not. At Galvion, we embrace an entrepreneurial mindset and foster the flexibility of a small company, while amassing the capabilities, deep market knowledge, user insights and understandings of a much larger company. This unique balance is what drives us to go beyond the obvious in order to provide innovative solutions that empower the missions of our end users. It is also what makes us a trusted development partner for military, government, industry and academia alike.

THOUGHT LEADERS, SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, AND SCIENTIFIC EXPLORERS

Innovation is in our DNA; its the foundation of our growth strategy. Our Research & Development team includes industry experts from a wide range of fields and pursuits, including physics, chemistry, advanced materials research, aerospace, ballistics, polymer chemistry, mechanical engineering, advanced laser research, industrial machine design, lean manufacturing and composite manufacturing. Our scientists have published hundreds of research papers; our thought leaders and subject matter experts moderate, present and participate in conferences regularly; we hold hundreds of patents and the weight of this history, expertise and knowledge is behind each new project we partner on, every program we win and deliver and any new product that Galvion develops.


   
BETTER PRODUCTS, SHORTER DEVELOPMENT TIMES

Galvions commitment to nimble teams and hands-on development have lead us to invest in prototyping and simulation processes that are critical to the development and eventual commercialization of any new product or technology. Our development teams imagine it, our design teams conceptualize it, our prototyping team makes it. We use cutting-edge software to create extremely accurate CAD drawings that are translated into 3-D models via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Using advanced algorithms, 3-D drawings are scanned with exacting detail and printed into full-size thermoplastic product replicas. The full-scale models are then reviewed by our design and Human Factors teams for analysis and integration testing and sent back with revisions and improvements until we have a production quality prototype.

This prototype undergoes rigorous validation testing in our in-house labs, as well as by end-users in real life scenarios. Each round of evaluation feeds back into this design loop, and only after all these hurdles are clearedexhaustive user trials and conclusive quality assurance and lab authenticationcan a product move on to full-scale manufacturing. Every Galvion productfrom our Batlskin head systems to Nerv Centr power management solutions, from our Silent Watch vehicle batteries to every advanced concept development project that we undertake  goes through this comprehensive iterative approach to design. Adherence to and refinement of this process allows Galvion to create sophisticated, advanced products. Owning and managing all the steps of this process in-house allows us to bring them to market faster.



OUR FOREMOST CONSIDERATION: USER EXPERIENCE

We live by one absolute principal: Enhance the effectiveness of soldiers, law enforcement and tactical personnel, and other demanding users through superior protection and innovation. The technical performance of our protective gear is without compromise  but for Galvion, our focus is on active, performance-enhancing equipment  making the operator faster, lighter and more connected than ever before. The ultimate goal is for protective gear to be the last line of defense, rather than the first. We continually engage with our end-users in order to proactively find ways to improve our existing products, but perhaps more importantly to understand the constantly changing needs and demands they face on their respective missions. We consult them throughout the development process, we field equipment to them for training exercises and we engage with them after they purchase our products. It is these relationships that drive our product development process, and inform where we invest and expand our capabilities.

Similarly, recruiting and hiring men and women with military and tactical experience is one of our core commitments. Throughout the company, we rely on these team members to provide insight and unique perspectives on exactly how equipment will be used, the ways in which it will interact with other gear, the environment and the soldier. The winning combination of our internal subject matter experts and our extensive and consistent external user trials, evaluations and engagement not only ensures that our designs are applicable and reliable in real world situations, but that a Galvion solution truly enhances operator effectiveness in the field.

Metaphorically Speaking...

Combat Ready is a well-known term used to describe the condition of a fully-trained, prepared, and equipped warfighter. Metaphorically, to be Combat Ready affirms one's efficacy and highest level of readiness to accomplish that in which he or she sets out to accomplish. It is this unwavering state of being thats infused in our name, and is the foundation of our brand.

We often referred to ourselves as our acronym, CRUSA.We were founded in 2006 by Colin Burgos, a former Infantryman for the United States Marine Corps, and Firefighter/Paramedic for the City of Dallas, Tx.

CRUSA was recognized in the White House Small Business Report as an emerging Veteran-Owned Small Disadvantaged Business in the 8(a) program. This program has provided us a platform for attaining valuable experience doing business with all branches of the US Military, providing a wide range of tactical gear items and learning the ins-and-outs of government procurement.

Our Philosophy:

We operate with a philosophy of readiness, efficiency, and adaptability. With these innate qualities as our foundation, our customers can rely on our ability to meet their product and delivery requirements, and provide the highest quality in customer service. Being ready and efficient means we have the knowledge and skillset to accomplish our objectives and perform to a higher standard of quality. By being adaptable, we move in a flexible manner, always seeking improvement, and fine-tuning the quality of our operation."

Video Depositions
Legal video depositions create a visual record of the deposition testimony. A video recording can be beneficial to any litigation process, and should be strongly considered when scheduling a deposition.

Virtually everyone would rather see it for themselves. Even if they claim to be old-fashioned, theres no substitute for seeing it with your own eyes and hearing it with your own ears. The camera captures every subtle nuance and reaction, every answer and hesitation  these are things that are, of course, 100% absent in a written record.

""10 Tips for Great Video"" (PDF)


Schedule a video deposition now by clicking here.

Reasons to use video at deposition:

Witness would be unavailable at time of trial
Expert witnesses and doctors
Witness impeachment
This tactic is an excellent method of showing contradictory statements, especially under oath and in full color. Deposition testimony may have taken place a long time before trial, and the tenor and specificity of the answers may be unrecognizable when the witness is answering similar questions on the witness stand. Witnesses often develop improved ways of answering questions they can identify as having been previously asked. The earlier video deposition testimony is often the best opportunity to get useful, unrehearsed live testimony regarding the facts of the case.

Montages (clips or segments) of selected portions of the video record can be created and used at Settlement Conferences, Motions for Summary Judgment, and even for opening and closing arguments to the Judge and jury.

Additional Video Format Options:

Synchronized MPEG-1 video on DVD formatted for:

Realtime
Realtime is the instantaneous translation of the court reporters stenographic notes into English. The Court Reporter cables directly to your computer, providing counsel with hands on access to the realtime testimony which appears on your computer screen.

To see a Realtime Deposition in action, watch this short Deposition Demo:



What does this mean for you? You are now able to privately interact with the witness testimony in real time. Totally eliminate the need for note taking by using the high-light and annotation features of the software [LiveNote]. Isolate every instance of interesting testimony and use the witness own words to help you frame new questions. Carefully review questions and answers as needed. You may retrieve a particular answer, and while the deposition is still in progress, you can pause your screen and instantly revisit a crucial phrase.

This powerful tool gives you the opportunity to focus your attention and your eyes on the witness demeanor, body language and the nonverbal things taking place at the deposition.

At the conclusion of the deposition, a rough ASCII draft of the entire days testimony is available for your use. This rough daily copy can be used to prepare you for tomorrows deposition, or it can be immediately given to your expert or co-counsel.

Realtime is the perfect remedy to the problems experienced by the hearing-impaired witness.

Internet Streaming Depositions
If you have Internet access, you can take advantage of Internet Streaming.
 of internet streaming depositions:



Internet Streaming allows attorneys to monitor or participate in a live deposition using a computer from a remote site. Internet Streaming delivers the live video stream of the testifying witness as well as a realtime translation of the court reporters stenographic notes into English. This enables text to be viewed alongside the video on a divided screen. You can enjoy complete access to the testimony while the deposition is in progress. From any location, you read the text, hear the audio, and see the video stream. You can also send and receive private messages between participants.

Any attorney can participate in the deposition experience no matter where he/she is physically located, saving time, travel expenses, and enjoying the added convenience Internet Streaming offers. A logistic's nightmare can be smoothly handled when dealing with multiple attorneys and parties, all with competing calendars and schedules.

After the deposition is concluded, the video and transcripts are synchronized so you can easily search the text and view the accompanying video simultaneously.

Internet Access and a Gradillas Court Reporter. The Competitive Edge.

Video/Text Synchronization
Maximize the use of your video depositions. Capture every image with video synchronization technology as it directly corresponds to the written text of the transcript. Essentially, the video plays alongside the scrolling text allowing immediate access to both.

Video/text synchronization coordinates the audio and video with the written words of the transcript, making it incredibly simple to review the transcript along with the related images. Imagine being able to capture and review the witness every subtle display of hesitation, nervous reaction, and tone of voice as it corresponds directly to the testimony. Much of the ability to evaluate the witness credibility and size up your opponents case is unavailable to you for any scrutiny without the video record. With the use of video/text synchronization you can have the best of both worlds.

 about High Definition Video Conferencing:



A video conference is much like a reality TV show -- a conference room, with a camera, microphones, and a big screen monitor that shares images of all the participants no matter where located. Everyone can see, hear, and interact with each other. Everything you can do in a face-to-face meeting you can do with Video Conferencing -- except shake hands.

Split screen facilitates examination of video clips, documents, and exhibits while simultaneously watching and listening to the witness. High Definition quality allows for more precise scrutiny of images and documents, and the 360 degree audio pickup distinguishes the location of speakers.

You can broadcast any file you have in your computer to any participant. Take depositions, conduct witness interviews, complete expert interviews, even settlement conferences  conveniently with participants spread across America.

We can find a video conference site close to a specific address or zip code anywhere in the USA through our global network of affiliates.

Information governance is the set of multi-disciplinary structures, policies, procedures, processes and controls implemented to manage information at an enterprise level, supporting an organization's immediate and future regulatory, legal, risk, environmental and operational requirements.



Information governance should determine the balance point between two potentially divergent organizational goals:



Extracting value from information
Reducing the potential risk of information


Information governance reduces organizational risk in the fields of compliance, operational transparency, and reducing expenditures associated with e-discovery and litigation response. An organization can establish a consistent and logical framework for employees to handle data through their information governance policies and procedures.

eDiscovery

Electronic discovery or eDiscovery refers to detection in legal proceedings such as litigation, government investigations, or Freedom of Information Act requests, where the information sought is in electronic format (often referred to as electronically stored information or ESI). EDiscovery is subject to rules of civil procedure and agreed-upon processes, often involving review for privilege and relevance before data are turned over to the requesting party.



The Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is a universal diagram that represents a conceptual view of these stages involved in the e-discovery process.

Welcome to Global Enterprises

Global Enterprises is an international company working to serve its clients by concentrating its efforts in three distinct areas:
Providing an array of financial, engineering, design, construction, management and procurement services.

Organizing low cost Finance for the procurement and export of U.S. goods and services.

Energy projects Global Enterprises International, Inc. is a Florida corporation formed in 1989.  Its original mission was confined to political, economic and security consulting with special emphasis on the Middle East.  At the request of its clients Global began to provide security and intelligence equipment and training to friendly Middle Eastern countries.  Eventually Global became unique in its field, offering security services that could not be found elsewhere.
Again at the request of some clients, Global became an international trader, mostly in cement and petroleum products.  Using key contacts in the Middle East and in Russian, Global has access to markets and products that enable it to supply products at very competitive prices.
In 2008 Global began to concentrate on construction and development.  Triggering this concentration was the acquisition of the Turkish construction company Eska, which included commitments for the long-term employment of Eskas key personnel, to include its former Chairman and CEO, Mr. Selim Edes.  Eska, with Mr. Edes at the helm, built many large structures and complexes to include housing and other base facilities for the U.S. Air Force at Incirlik, Turkey; The Atakoy Tourism Center, Istanbul; Atasehir Project, Club Aldiana & Paradise in Antalya; the Dalyan-Bostanci Land Reclamation Project in Istanbul and finally the Atakoy Galleria in Istanbul.  More information about these projects can be Vision. Our company has extensive experience in the Middle East area and we are committed to strengthening the economies and infrastructure of the countries in which we work. We see the big picture and wish to participate in building strong nations that are economically and politically vibrant.

Integrity. While we are a private company that must watch the bottom line, we are committed to dealing honestly and fairly with our clients so that we are able to deliver a world class product at a fair price, while still making a reasonable profit.

Experience. Our staff has extensive experience in developing large scale projects from the initial concept and design to final completion. We also have extensive experience in the area and know how to seamlessly blend our development efforts with the cultural customs of the area.

Relationships. While Global has a vast amount of experience in project development, we are not experts in all fields and thus we have teamed with other companies who have the expertise we may lack. Additionally, we have close ties to a number financial institutes and through these ties we are able to provide our clients with low cost financing. Lastly, we have relationships with a number of U.S. manufacturers that allow us to obtain priority access to products so that projects can develop and come to fruition quickly.

At the request of its clients Global began to provide security and intelligence equipment and training to friendly Middle Eastern countries.

More information about these projects can be found under Our Activities > Completed Projects"" section.

Energy / Electricty	 
Global has developed a close working relationship with United Technologies Corporation (UTC), whose subsidiaries include Pratt & Whitney and Clipper. Pratt & Whitney is best known for its jet engines, and they have adapted these engines for use as electrical producing turbines. Pratt & Whitney's MobilePac, which produces 25 MW of power, comes in two trailers which can be delivered in one aircraft and installed within 8 hours after arrival on site. The MobilePacs are indeed mobile, so if emergencies develop, they can easily be transferred to other areas.

Pratt & Whitney also produces a SwiftPac Power Plant that can provide either 30 or 60 MW of power using either gas or diesel fuel. In 2013 Pratt & Whitney will also produce a 120 MW power plant. While the SwiftPacs are not as mobile or as quickly installed as the MobilePacs, they can be installed in less than 30 days with minimal site preparation, thus delivering reliable power in a very short period of time.

As mentioned above Clipper is also part of the UTC family and Global works closely with them too. Clipper produces a 2.5 MW wind turbine that uses the latest wind technology and is extremely easy to maintain. Wind turbines are growing more important in today's environmentally concerned world, and in areas with good wind conditions they offer a favorable alternative to fossil fuel turbines.

Global's engineers are can maintain a wide variety of power plants and many different kinds of turbines. We also have the capability of refurbishing turbines that are either not operable or are not operating at efficient levels. We can refurbish such turbines and return them to ""as new"" condition.

Also in the Energy area, Global offers solutions that can transfer municipal waste into electrical energy. These solutions, like wind solutions, are becoming more attractive to environmentally concerned nations and offer a much more sanitary solution to waste than landfills.		


Construction	 
Global or one of our teaming partners has experience in almost all areas of construction to include:
Schools
Hospitals
Dams
Housing projects
Power plants
Bridges
Drainage and Sewer systems
Airports


Multi-Fold System

A construction system called multi-fold reinforced concrete system for casting the concrete of houses and apartment buildings very rapidly where walls and slabs were cast on top of each other, connected with hinges and lifted the units to unfold into apartments.

First application was the Family Housing Project at US Air Force Air Base at Incirlik, Adana, Turkey during 1981 and 1982. Close to 1000 family houses were built with a fast track design-build method.During the following ten years the system was used successfully in many projects.

The application was basically for projects with multi-storey buildings of 500 or more units. The application of the system exceeded 2 million square meters. All the projects executed with this system were completed turn- key in less than 12 months.

Among the clients were US Air Force (Military family housing), Turkish Ministry of Defense (Military family housing), Turkish Ministry of Interior (Family housing for policemen), Municipality of Istanbul (Housing for Municipality staff), Turkish Ministry of Education (Dormitories for 20,000 students completed turn-key design- build including FF&E in 4 months).

Finance	 
Global maintains close relationships with a number of financial institutes that can benefit our clients and Global's own projects. Specifically, we can arrange loans at low interest rates on large projects with U.S. Government agencies, such as the United States Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). EXIM rates and terms are subject to change in each country, but typical long term loans are for 10 years. However, ""green projects"", such as wind driven power plants or solar power, can extend the term of a loan to 20 years. In cases where U.S. agencies are not appropriate for financial support, we can turn to commercial institutes with whom we also have excellent relations. We have experts who work with these various institutes and they can help our clients obtain the best financial solution available for their projects."

Cherokee Federal's team of companies offer a unique approach to humanitarian solutions through a unifying concept called Team Hope.

Team Hope is a group of uniquely capable and passionate professionals focused on provided specialized staffing resources, emergency services and the critical assets and systems needed to deliver culturally compassionate care to vulnerable populations. We have partnered with the federal government in response to dozens of urgent missions around the globe. Our most recent experience includes caring for and reuniting children from the Northern Triangle with parents or sponsors and supporting Afghan refugees whove fled their home country to seek safety in the U.S.

100% of our profits go to serve citizens of the Cherokee Nation, many who are still impacted by multi-generational impacts of cultural uprooting, a nearly impossible journey filled with stories of loss, resiliency and triumph. 

 

This a full circle moment for us, a population of resettlement survivors and their descendants. Our work allows us to give hope to vulnerable people in need of compassionate and culturally appropriate care. We see this as an opportunity to alter the course of history by creating a more hopeful future for those we serve and generations to follow.

Rapid Response Past Performance
Cherokee is equipped to respond to COVID-19 in ways that few federal contractors begin to approach. Our team of companies offer an array of services and expertise. Below are examples of our ability to respond rapidly, reliably and responsibly in times of need.

When Seconds Matter: Deepwater Horizon Spill Recovery
Within 36 hours of receiving notice to pursue work addressing the Deepwater Horizon spill, Cherokee responded. Across the Gulf of Mexico, Cherokee rapidly dispatched 75 safety auditors and observers. Our well-trained staff had OSHA 40-hour Hazwoper and HAZMAT certifications, ensuring avoidance of workplace hazards during the long effort to mitigate the environmental impact of a 4.9-million-barrel oil spill.
Renowned Expertise: Hurricane Katrina Disaster Recovery Assistance
By quickly ramping up the necessary staff in response to Hurricane Katrina, Cherokees technical support services assisted federal recovery efforts throughout Louisiana and Mississippi  helping affected communities rebuild at every step along the way. The technical support team provided critical public assistance operations and complete debris removal, while our civil and structural engineering support team restored community infrastructure. Our municipal cost accounting provided important oversight, and together with our architectural and construction review, ensured the responsible standards Cherokee adheres to on all contracts were set in stone.

 

Reliable from Start to Finish: Five Years of 100% Supplier Performance
Cherokee Federals team of engineering and manufacturing companies has a long history of providing superior service on long-running programs with difficult technical requirements. For this five-year defense contract, Cherokee produced interconnect wire assemblies, instrument panels and other limited source details for military aircraft. Cherokee maintained a supplier performance rating of 100%, on both quality and delivery, for the duration of the program. Through seamless integration and constant communication, our quality, manufacturing, testing, engineering and product launch teams proactively identified and mitigated risks. The contract was a build-to-print requirement, with approximately 500 engineering changes from the defense firm on the products Cherokee manufactured.

 

Consistent Quality at Any Scale
When demand surges, Cherokee scales whether its establishing call centers and support desks or manufacturing products that power life-saving equipment, like tactical quiet generators (TQGs). During a 10-year contract to manufacture TQGs for a defense contractor, Cherokee maintained a >99% on-time delivery and quality rating. Continuous improvement that utilized Kaizen, 5S, and other lean tools gave Cherokee the flexibility to scale rapidly. Surge demand from our customers increased monthly deliveries of TQGs as much as 25% with very little notice, and without cutting corners. To anticipate such demand, Cherokee maintained quality and on-time delivery through a production cell concept. This concept minimized wasted motion, improved product flow and resolved product issues. Production cells demonstrably improved the overall efficiency of TQG build and test times  year after year."

Inspect, adjust, and lubricate springs
As the most dangerous feature of any garage door, NEVER attempt to repair your doors spring. Inspect regularly and have a professional make all necessary repairs.

Inspect spring mounting pad for cracks and splits
Inspect door and track alignment/balance
If your garage door, and its tracks, arent properly balanced or aligned, it wont properly open. Over time, this improper opening will cause issues in all other parts of your system.

Inspect and lubricate all rollers
Rollers, regardless of material, need to be inspected twice per year and replaced every 7 years. If any chips, excessive wear, or cracks are detected, rollers should be replaced immediately.

Inspect and tighten hinges and hardware
The average garage door door moves up and down more than a thousand times a year.

Lubricate all bearings
Inspect cables for wear or damage
With enough force to cause death, never tinker with high-tension cables. However, its important to check for any damage and if damage is present, have cables replaced immediately.

Inspect locks for proper operation
Inspect weather strip for wear or damage
If the rubber weather stripping on the bottom of your door, and along the garage door frame, are cracked or brittle, replacement is needed. A proper seal keeps the elements out and proper energy efficiency in.

Garage Door Openers

Inspect for proper operation
Adjust up and down force sensitivity
Tighten drive chain/belt as needed

The Digital Fault Recorder (DFR) function of the USI DME systems provides our customers with the ability to analyze system protection operations and circuit breaker performance. USI DRFs record instantaneous values (waveforms) of current and voltages, which are sampled many times per cycle, for time periods on the order of a second. May also record computed quantities

Overall, the purpose of a DFR includes recording power system events (voltage & current magnitudes), capturing the exact time at which a fault occurred, power swings, and abnormal instruments transformer behavior, such as CT saturation, DC offset (inductance of the system), and CCVT response. Additionally, a DFR monitors the protection systems performance and checks the power system for failures of a relay to operate as intended (retrofit, trip test switch open, etc.), incorrect tripping of terminals for external faults, determining the optimum line reclose delay, and failure of fault interrupting devices.

Sequence of Events Recorder (SER)?
The Sequence of Events Recorder (SER) function can be found in both USI DME systems and standalone USI SER systems. The SER function monitors external inputs and records status changes that occur in the power system. To accomplish this function the SER samples and time stamps operational data in the chronological sequence in which the events take place. This operational data is monitored from substation equipment (i.e., relays, circuit breakers, etc.) and control schemes (automatic and manual) as they react to an event that takes place within the power systems the SER is monitoring. When collected, this data, which can be caused by several different individual events such as a switching operation, mis-operation, or fault, allows the chain of events to be analyzed and studied when searching for the cause of an event that took place within the power systems, as well as the linkages between individual actions and effects.

Why RevCom?

RevComs parallel review process allows expert reviewers and approvers within different offices and at various sites to work on the same policy or procedure simultaneously and privately, supporting a quicker review while maintaining tight version controls.

RevCom enables large-scale reviews in which all of the relevant comments, edits, clearances, and approvals are returned quickly in a single, integrated document.

The collaborative review process allows the expert reviewers in a group to freely discuss the relative merits of a draft within the group, and their comments will remain private until the results of their review are approved for release and posted by the coordinator for the group, at which time they become visible to all of the other reviewing groups.

RevCom controls the process and schedule for draft development, review, and approval.

RevCom for Standards
Go beyond basic balloting and markup

RevCom allows you to work your draft standards easily with the people who are responsible for getting the job doneso that the published standards actually work.

RevComs parallel, collaborative review process allows different organizations to work on the same document at the same time, for a broader review in a shorter period of time.

Keeping pace with standards development in a globalized world

Advances in global communications demand rapid development of critical industry standards. This substantially increases the burden on subject matter experts and reviewers.
RevCom facilitates the updating of a single standard  or an entire set of standards.
Without RevComs capabilities, large-scale coordination of new and revised standards is a slow and tedious process.

RevCom for Regulations and Rulemaking
Improving the regulatory document review and clearance process

With RevCom, you can count on a successful rulemaking process which holds its management and staff accountable to interim and final deadlines.

Quick and controlled

RevCom supports a quicker review while maintaining tight version controls for all of the documents on the rule-making docket. Different reviewers can examine the proposed rule-making concurrently, rather than sequentially, throughout the rule-making process.

RevCom allows reviewers within different offices and across agency boundaries to work on the same rule-making docket simultaneously and privately, supporting a quicker review while maintaining tight version controls for all of the documents on the docket.

RevCom enables large-scale reviews in which all of the relevant comments, edits, clearances, and approvals are returned quickly and embedded where they belong within individual documents.

Accountable to deadlines

A successful rule-making process holds management and staff accountable to interim and final deadlines.

Substantive vs. Editorial reviews

When forced to use a word processor to review draft notices and regulations, reviewers often spend too much time making unnecessary editorial corrections and not enough time focusing their efforts on substantive legal and policy issues. RevCom makes it easy for reviewers and approvers to ask questions, suggest changes, and point out inconsistencies without having to actually edit or re-write the document.

Although RevCom reviewers work directly online in real-time, their work can be seen only within their own groups or offices until the results of the review are posted. This allows the reviewers to collaborate privately until they are ready to submit their final review package for the rest of the department to see.

Dynamic Systems, Inc. (DSI), a national turnkey mechanical and process construction firm, is committed to being an industry leader. We offer preconstruction and construction services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to our customers across an entire spectrum of industries and systems. To date, weve completed more than 4,000 projects, delivering superior user experience and bottom line performance.

Office buildings that have cleaner air. Airport terminals that have reduced noise and emissions. Hospitals that provide optimum patient comfort. Laboratories that are the safest for technicians. And central utility plants with cooling and heating systems performing double duty saving energy and costs. Thats a better way to build.

Specializing in Diverse Markets and Systems
Commercial & Specialty

For almost 30 years, DSI has been a leader in creating healthy and energy-efficient environments for Commercial & Specialty markets, including:

Airport terminals
Corporate offices/campuses
University/college campuses
Correctional facilities
Solar manufacturing
Challenges include high occupant densities, proximity to food services and environmental noise pollution. Our strategies incorporate energy-efficient and quiet underfloor air delivery and displacement air concepts that radically improve the environment. These strategies include CO2 monitoring, pressurization control and maintaining critical outside air delivery to deliver healthy environments in every building we construct.


For almost three decades, DSI has created forward-thinking, efficient environments for the higher education market. Projects have included university and college academic buildings, professional schools (veterinary and medical), libraries, laboratories and operations facilities.

DSIs scope includes HVAC, mechanical, sheet metal, plumbing and equipment start-up, in many cases without impacting or disrupting ongoing classes. Some of these have achieved a LEED-Gold rating.


Managing successful healthcare projects is a complex process, requiring managers and teams with proven experience and detailed knowledge of specialized design and construction principles. DSI offers comprehensive resources and industry expertise to meet a full range of healthcare needs.

We have completed more than $1 billion in healthcare projects, ranging from new medical centers and research facilities to building renovations. These include ambulatory and specialty care centers, (clean room and BSL standards), blood and chemistry labs and medical office buildings. We bring specialization in:

Medical gas systems
Surgical environments
Imaging facilities
Critical system infrastructure
Installed by skilled technical staff, these systems are delivered precisely commissioned to assure flawless operation. We are proud to contribute to the healthcare industry and to know the projects weve completed will serve patients and families for years to come.

DSI has worked on award-winning hospitality projects, offering customized preconstruction and construction services to our clients. Whether a new flagship hotel, casino or water park, we will prove the best value for your project. Plus, deliver exceptional quality.

Laboratory infrastructure relies heavily on extensive mechanical HVAC and plumbing systems, contain fume hoods, toxic and hazardous chemicals, cleanrooms, waste neutralization, lab gases and ultrapure water. Integrating these systems relies heavily on fully coordinating the BIM model. We have significant 3D design capabilities that allow us to develop a fully coordinated facility.

Considerations for safety include toxic and flammable chemicals. We deliver high-quality installations, fully understanding the safety of the lab technicians is paramount.

Large energy consuming outside and exhaust air systems are required to properly ventilate the spaces. We emphasize design solutions for energy reclamation to reduce this consumption.?Ventilation rates can also be optimized through monitoring of airborne contaminants. Collaboration with contaminant monitoring systems that interface with the HVAC controls can further reduce energy consumption.

Biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are extremely complex and exacting. Our team has extensive experience in the fabrication and installation of hygienic piping systems and process equipment for FDA- regulated facilities. Additionally, we provide accurate QA/QC documentation for project turnover packages assuring complete compliance for your IQ and OQ protocols.

To meet the challenges of these rigorous standards, we take a collaborative team approach that involves professionals from each discipline in every stage of the project. This approach enables us to closely manage the complete project scope from preconstruction planning and design to restoration and turnover.

The microelectronic industry is a significant component of our diverse construction experience. Much of our history is based on the construction of these exacting facilities. DSI has been extremely successful on these projects that require on-time delivery at a relentless pace and an exceptional quality level.

The systems we commonly install in microelectronic facilities include:

Toxic gas delivery
Scrubbed acid exhaust
Ultrapure DI water
Cleanroom HVAC
Acid neutralization facilities
Process cooling water
Solvent waste systems
Bulk gas delivery
Bulk chemical delivery
Cryogenic gas delivery

The focus of Mission Critical Facilities design and construction is protecting and sustaining clients vital intellectual property and sustaining operations. DSIs quality and reliability deliver the functionality to ensure uninterrupted 24/7 operation. High quality and timely construction are requirements  not goals.

The virtually constant high-cooling loads in these facilities present energy-saving opportunities we adeptly use to your advantage. Large thermal storage tanks allow chilled water production during off peak hours. Lower energy costs during these hours save cost and create efficiency in power plant operations.

Chiller optimization control solutions determine the best operating conditions after assessing operation variables. The most efficiently tuned chiller plants benefit from a complete understanding of these variables during commissioning."

Our team has provided Cyber and Information Security programs across the federal sector, NC Utilities and commercial venues to enhance the clients capability to achieve effective operational results without reducing effectiveness due to restrictive communication protocols. The following sections summarize these capabilities and provide the foundation for Golden to build a tailored approach to safeguard and protect your vital assets.

National Institute Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework:

Golden Svcs' cyber experts have extensive experience participating in the collaborative development of the NIST Framework.  Our team has effectively implemented the Framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure to protect critical assets. Golden Svcs' team members leverage the prioritized, flexible, repeatable, and cost-effective Framework approach to provide clients the capability to manage Cybersecurity risk to the lowest possible level. 

As an industry leader Golden Svcs provides the foundation and understanding to work with FISMA clients to provide insight for how the NIST Framework can be used in collaboration to provide defense in depth and reduce client risk.

Risk Management Consulting:

With the ever-increasing reliance organizations have on their information infrastructure it is important to understand and manage the potential risks that exist to that infrastructure. A risk assessment is a comprehensive analysis of all factors that impact the overall operation of your information infrastructure and its impact on your ability to operate. Risk assessment is not just important with existing information infrastructures but should also be performed before designing and implementing new information infrastructures.

Golden Svcs team members have conducted risk assessments for Federal Government and Corporate entities. Our team members were picked by a Federal Government agency to perform a requirements study for their next generation supercomputers. The customer was interested in determining where to locate their next generation supercomputer system that would minimize risk. This study included sizing requirements, location requirements, energy pricing, Federal cyber security requirements, and the impact of environmental events.

Security Architecture Design and Implementation:

Whether you have an existing information system in which you wish to remediate risks or you are planning a new information system, Golden Svcs can design a security architecture taking into account existing preferences in operating system, software and service providers. Both comprehensive and component specific designs can be developed. Architecture can be designed to be NIST compliant.

Golden Svcs team members have provided detailed security architecture studies to multiple federal customers. In one study the customer wished to determine solutions for providing an integrated approach for Common Directory Services, Patch Management, Auditing, and Secure Transmission of information. This study took into account existing software, near term future software acquisitions, current and future Federal requirements, difficulty of implementation, inter-operation across the organization and cost. In another study, the customer wanted a security review of its border gateway routers security configuration settings and a design of an improved configuration that would reduce risk. We successfully performed the study and provided comprehensive results to facilitate the clients success.

Monitoring Services:

Active monitoring of the information infrastructure is required to maintain a secure system. This includes monitoring of audit logs, configuration files, system integrity intrusion detection systems output, and internal traffic flow.  Golden Svcs can provide monitoring services as well as consulting on the various software options for automating the process.

Golden Svcs extensive experience provide the foundation for our team to provide capabilities to design, build, and operate Security Operation Centers (SOC) that will provide real-time situational awareness for the information infrastructure. Golden staff members have extensive experience in SOC development, implementation, and operations.

Vulnerability Management:

Cyber Security is a highly dynamic field with new vulnerabilities being discovered daily. Each of these vulnerabilities has the potential of significantly affecting the security of your system. Vulnerability scanning and patch management is essential to maintain a security information infrastructure. Golden Svcs has conducted vulnerability assessments for both Federal Government and Corporate entities. Golden can provide vulnerability scanning as well as patch management services for clients.

Penetration Testing:

A penetration test differs from a vulnerability assessment/test in that in a penetration test the vulnerabilities are not only assessed but they are also exploited to validate they are accessible. Further, a penetration tests determine how far a hacker can penetrate your defense and can validate the potential damage can be done to your system. Golden performs penetration tests for both federal agencies and corporations. 

Certification& Accreditation (C&A):

Our Certification and Accreditations program is designed for systems that must meet federal cyber security requirements. The C&A is based on the NIST 800-53 and 800-53A standards and includes; risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, testing, and critical systems penetration test.

Golden Svcs team members have performed numerous Certification and Accreditations for Federal customers and for companies that require NIST certification.

Training and Awareness:

Training and cyber security awareness seminars are essential in creating awareness of cyber security issues and their impact on organizational functionality. Untrained employees are easily susceptible to social engineering attacks and are less likely to detect insider attacks. Golden team members have extensive experience in providing professional seminars, complete courses of instruction, and designing comprehensive training programs/plans.

Continuity of Operations/Disaster Recovery (COOP/DR):

Having a continuity of operation plan (COOP) is essential in ensuring critical operations that can continue in the advent of an environmental and/or cyber event that brings down your primary information systems. Golden can develop a comprehensive plan to ensure continuity of operations and minimize time to reconstitute the primary information systems. Additionally, we can evaluate your existing plan and provide value added recommendations to enhance effectiveness and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Golden Svcs' goal is to provide a diverse yet focused portfolio of services executed through a team of professional associates who are vested in our goal and dedicated to provide quality services at a market competitive value.

Do you simply need project management? Well oversee your subcontractors to ensure the smoothest and best possible execution of your job.

Just want us to install the fiber optic network per your design? Well deploy our construction crews to place the cable on your system.  

Would you like Wolf Line Construction to design and build the very best network for you and your customers, start to finish? We will partner with you to deliver excellence, and if youd like well handle system operation once the job is complete.  

 

Turn-Key Fiber Optic Cable Deployment, Start to Finish

While each project has a unique design, the turn-key process is typically the same.

The project design begins with field surveys, mapping (evaluating your current assets), and planning, working closely with you to ensure the correct design for you and your customers. Once the design is complete our engineers create field plans. These serve as a roadmap for budgeting and defining whats needed for the build. 

Based on these plans and drawings we order the appropriate type and amount of material. We will have briefed you throughout the process, and youll have plenty of opportunity for input.

We then deploy our construction crews to install your fiber optic network. Once all the fiber optic installation is fully deployed, we produce the as-builts, which are marked-up drawings and operational plans for quality assurance. We then set up a maintenance package which we manage  or we turn the maintenance package and system over to you.  

 

Rooted in Rural

While we also work in small town centers, our specialty is providing high speed data access to underserved rural areas, because our company is rooted in rural. 

Youll feel our pride when you work with us and youll see it in the product we deliver. Our expertise allows us to work closely with you to design and deploy a broadband project that fits both your needs and budget. 

Did you see how we work in rural environments? Well make sure your customers are very happy  not just with their new digital access but with the process, too.   "

Automatic, Non-Toxic, and Quick Kill
Rats and mice thrive because of humansthey feed on the garbage and byproducts that we create. Unfortunately, killing them is often necessary. That said, its our responsibility to make sure were going about it in the right way.

We believe passionately in eradicating rats and mice in a safe, quick kill, and efficient manner. Our vision is to eliminate preventable suffering of these rodents and we feel we're one step closer with every trap we ship.

Building A Better Mouse Trap
Sadly, the three most common ways to kill ratsglue traps, snap traps, and poisonare incredibly cruel. Glue traps are an inhumane and unnecessary way to end a rodents life. Snap traps often fail to kill quickly, and they only work on either rats or mice. Poison results in a slow, painful death and exposes other wildlife, such as predator birds, to the same harm.

At Automatic Trap, were breaking the cycle of inhumane and potentially harmful rodent controlthrough the distribution of the A24 Rat and Mouse trap. We offer a pragmatic solution that eliminates rats and mice in the most quick kill and efficient way possible.

Who We Are
Automatic Trap Inc. was started in 2016 by entrepreneur and Founder, Blair Calder. Were the exclusive distributor Goodnature A24 in Canada and the United States. The A24 was created by conservationists in New Zealand to protect local bird populations from invasive mammals.

The Goodnature A24 Rat and Mouse Trap was designed using innovative and advanced manufacturing processes, while focusing on quick kill methods. The A24 is quick kill, toxin-free, kills rodents instantly, and automatically resets for up to 24 kills."
